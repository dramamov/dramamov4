00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.020
Your ID card was deactivated
upon your termination.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.350
Ma'am, that's enough.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.260
- Ma'am, that's enough.
- Leave me alone!

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.720
Do you have any idea who I am?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.700
What's going on here?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.070
She's an outsider.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.840
Are you going to let her in?

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.380
- Let's go, ma'am.
- Let go of me!

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.150
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.320
Let go!

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.950
I'm Min Kyung Chae
of Mingang Distribution!

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.590
Let me go!

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.760
Let go!

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760
Unbelievable.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.410
(Episode 84)

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.380
Hey, Yeon Ah.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.420
You know what tomorrow is, right?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.080
Of course, I do.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.120
We have to go celebrate with Mi So.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.560
Of course.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.130
(Mingang Distribution)

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Did you really have to go that far?

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.170
You'll get what's coming to you for this.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.070
What did you just say?

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.510
Did you have to drive out
the poor CEO to make yourself happy?

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.180
Is that what you're here to argue about?

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.580
Listen, Baek Sul Hee.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.010
I know this is revenge for our daughter,
but this is going too far.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.120
Mi So wasn't just your daughter.
She was my daughter, too.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.220
Your daughter?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.090
That's right. My daughter.
My own flesh and blood.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.130
You wrecked someone else's company
to steal the CEO position.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.430
Do you think she's looking down
happy about any of this?

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.940
Don't you dare say her name
with that filthy mouth.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.270
That's why...

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.940
you've done enough.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.710
Stop this. Right now.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.580
No. I'm just getting started.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.720
Doing this won't bring her back.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.980
That's why I have to do this...

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.320
because she's not coming back!

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.190
Since we're on the subject,
do you even know what tomorrow is?

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.260
It's Mi So's 20th birthday.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.570
She would have been so beautiful
at the best time of her life.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.600
Do you know what I'm going through today?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.470
How dare you lecture me
about our daughter!

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.710
After all this time, now you care?

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.670
She was your daughter, too?

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.510
If you considered Mi So your daughter,
you wouldn't be defending Min Kyung Chae.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.920
How can a father...

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.120
side with his own child's enemy?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.790
You're spineless, but this is too much.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.660
Who do you think
did that to your daughter?

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.330
So get out of my sight.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.670
You were never a father to her.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.470
Becoming CEO has really gone to her head.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680
Then again,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.910
she's the one in charge
of Mingang Distribution now.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.720
(Director Min Soo Jung)

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.390
Hey!

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.120
Soo Jung!

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.390
You won't believe what I just saw.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.560
What now?

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.100
Kyung Chae was just dragged
out of the building.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Dragged out?

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.770
That woman takes the CEO position,
and her first act is firing Kyung Chae.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.570
It's a bloodbath.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.370
She's crossed the line.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.770
Regardless of the reason,
this is too much.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.910
That's what I'm saying!

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.350
Come on. No matter how much of a pain
Kyung Chae is, this is just wrong.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.280
If we let this go, we could be next.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.220
What's to stop her from coming after us?

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.020
She's basically declaring war
by taking out her rival...

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.520
after becoming CEO, right?

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.820
She thinks she's untouchable now.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.590
I swear, that woman...

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.060
Hey, Min Soo Jung!
You're coming with me! Darn it.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.010
(Mingang Distribution)

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.410
What's all this commotion?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.820
Is it true you fired my sister?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.350
I heard she was just dragged
out of the building.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.020
They dragged her out like a dog.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.020
That's rich.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.230
When were you ever concerned
for your half-sister?

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.860
Excuse me?

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.700
Weren't you two worse than enemies?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.630
Weren't you the one who begged me
to remove Min Kyung Chae as the CEO?

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.500
You did that?

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.940
But that didn't mean I wanted you
to take her place!

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.080
Have you already forgotten
about your birth mother?

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.880
That's a separate issue.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.610
Are you really going to fire my sister
just like this?

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.450
She had it coming. The chairman is aware.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.750
Can you do whatever you want
as long as the chairman knows?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.790
So, does this mean Jung Lucia is
calling the shots at Mingang now?

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.760
The shot caller of Mingang...

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.930
I like the sound of that.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.700
So you'd better grovel.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.670
If you don't want to end up fired
like your sister.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.010
What are you doing home at this hour?

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.990
What's wrong, Ms. Kyung Chae?

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.760
What is it?

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.240
Don't tell me that woman
kicked you out of the company.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.020
Right now, our team has an opening
due to Min Kyung Chae's dismissal,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.490
and that spot will be filled by a transfer
from another department,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.190
or until we get a new hire.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.030
Otherwise, we'll have to manage
with the current team.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.960
It's going to be one or the other.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.700
So, what do you think?

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.130
Let's just stick with our current team.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.030
A new person would just
make things awkward,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.870
and to be honest,
those few days were tough enough.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.970
I agree. We're all so in sync,

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.780
and bringing in the wrong person
could mess up our teamwork.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.210
That's true.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.710
We've been the core members
since the online team formed.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.180
Anyone new would just feel
like an outsider.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.220
Okay. I understand what you're all saying.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.490
And it's true, when it comes to teamwork,
no other team can touch us.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.730
Look at them, subtly bad-mouthing her.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.560
No matter what a wreck
Kyung Chae is in right now,

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.400
how can they be so cheerful
the second she's gone?

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.170
Vice Director Min.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.370
Do you have something to say?

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.410
No. I have nothing to say at all.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.750
It looks like you have something
on your mind.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.080
I said I don't.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.790
How does it feel...

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.260
after kicking Min Kyung Chae out
of Mingang?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.130
I should feel great,
but it hasn't really sunk in yet.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.260
Mingang was her life, her entire goal.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.530
Now that she's been
completely tossed aside,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.030
she's going to fall apart mentally.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.940
I'm sure she will.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.240
The CEO role was never
just a title to her.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.080
Now, no matter what anyone says,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.910
you're the second-in-command
at Mingang, Lucia.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.150
She won't have any power
on the Board of Directors anymore, either.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.020
So, does the real battle
for the shares start now?

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.650
It has to.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.990
Depending on who holds the most shares
of Mingang Distribution,

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.890
the de facto owner of Mingang
will be decided.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.000
The owner of Mingang...

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.630
It'll be impossible to get any more shares
from Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.100
So now, the key is...

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.440
to sway the Board's shares
that were with Min Kyung Chae...

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.500
and bring them over to our side.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.350
What are you thinking so deeply about?

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.880
Lucia.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.350
What about her?

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.250
Something about her makes me uneasy.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.760
I know there's nothing more unpredictable
than a person's heart,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.430
but still, this just doesn't feel right.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.100
Has she had a change of heart
or something?

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.400
I think Lucia is starting to
see that girl, Se Ri, as her own daughter.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.400
No way.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.570
She was the reason
Lucia lost her child. How can that be?

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.940
I don't think Lucia herself realizes it,
but that's how I see it.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.380
That explains why she'd jump
in there to save the kid.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.720
Did she grow fond of her
from living in the same house?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.490
Does that even make sense?

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.720
To think she married that man for revenge,
only to grow fond of his own daughter.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.760
Besides, who started this whole
cursed relationship in the first place?

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.380
What's up with Kyung Chae?
She's been acting weird.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.750
- She's acting like she's lost her mind.
- This isn't happening!

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.450
She's not in her right mind right now.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.450
And how could she be?

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.550
That woman... I mean, Madam Jung...

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.490
I heard she had Ms. Kyung Chae
fired from the company.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.200
Do you still think she's so great?

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.100
She must've had her reasons.
She wouldn't do that for nothing.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.700
It's going to be tense around the house,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.870
so you should get out for a little while.
Go see a friend or something.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.450
Min Se Ri?

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.060
- Who are you?
- I'm your stepmom's best friend.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.690
Can we talk for a minute?
I have something to tell you.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.530
Why did you suddenly want to meet,
Grandma?

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.830
Come to think of it,
you always call me "Grandma."

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.570
I may be old enough to be one,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.370
but I certainly don't look the part.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.210
Whatever. You look like a grandma to me.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.050
Who on earth does she take after?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.050
She's nothing like Min Kyung Chae,

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.720
so she's definitely not Ho Se's kid.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.720
There's zero resemblance.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.860
But there's something
oddly familiar about her.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.730
Who could she look like?

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.970
What is it?

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.530
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.100
No. It's nothing.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.440
I was just surprised you came to meet me
without putting up a fight.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.550
I just needed some fresh air.
It's a little tense at home.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.520
Is something going on at home?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.420
That's none of your business.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.930
- Did you meet with her?
- I did.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:33.400
I looked her over with a hawk's eye
for a good hour.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.500
- And?
- She's nothing like Min Kyung Chae.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.440
- So she must take after her dad.
- I don't know about that,

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.910
but as I was looking at her,

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.010
she reminded me of someone.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.350
Who was it?

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.950
Never mind.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.550
Who is it?

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.960
You don't look so well.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.400
I'm just tired.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.970
Meetings and conferences all day.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.970
You should rest.
I'll go warm up your herbal medicine.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.270
About Kyung Chae...

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.710
I let her go from the company today.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.210
So you fired her.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.150
Are you upset about it?

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.380
Upset? If that's what you decided,
then that's that.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.760
She grew up with Mingang Distribution,
so this won't be easy for her to accept.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.960
It wasn't an easy decision for me either.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.360
But if I'd kept her on,

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.460
I was afraid something
irreversible might happen.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.330
I know what you mean.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.300
I'm fine with it. As long as you're happy,
that's all that matters.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.250
The chairman is tired.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.920
If it's not urgent, come back later.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.230
Even if she is the CEO,

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.270
she can't just fire me like this.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.800
Personnel decisions are
the CEO's prerogative.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.310
So what are you then, Father?
A figurehead?

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.340
If you're just going to let that woman
do whatever she wants.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.650
This right here is why you were fired.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.550
If you were going to do this,
why did you call me back from the States?

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.350
You should have just let me stay there
with the man I love.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.250
Believe me,
I regret it more than you know.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.760
I never knew you could sink this low.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.230
Dumping your own father in a nursing home,
playing tricks on someone with allergies,

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:47.670
getting so jealous when someone succeeds
that you try to sabotage a deal,

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.130
and to top it all off, you even locked
a person in the supply room.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.570
Was that really so wrong?

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.410
Have you lived your entire life
without making a single mistake, Father?

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.440
You've never sinned?

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.010
I was just trying to do well.
I can't control the outcome!

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.780
Can't we just put it behind us?

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.810
What's the point of keeping score
between a father and daughter?

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.360
I'll do better.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.160
If you just give me my job back,

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.900
I'll work hard to make
Mingang Distribution number one in Korea,

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.330
no, the number one distribution company
in the world.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.170
So please, let's just go back
to how things were.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.340
Please, Father?

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.510
Let's go back to how it was...

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.980
before that woman ever came
into our company,

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.310
and before she ever set foot in our home.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.380
It's far too late for that.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.490
Father.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.160
What are you doing?

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.970
I'd rather die than be kicked out
of the company.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.440
- What?
- Kill me.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.870
Taking Mingang from me
is a death sentence.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.140
You've completely lost your mind.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.650
It would be an honor to die at your hands.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.680
Since you're Mingang's great founder,
the titan of distribution in Korea.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.420
Are you really going to act like this?

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.220
Why?

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.690
Can't bring yourself to do it?

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.220
I guess not. I'm your daughter, after all.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.760
Then you have to let me live.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.630
You can't just take Mingang away from me!
It's my whole life!

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.700
What are you all doing?
Get this thing out of here.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.700
Either give me back the CEO position,
or kill me right here, right now.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.310
- This girl has lost it.
- Kyung Chae.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.810
- Ms. Kyung Chae!
- I said, kill me already!

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.110
Kill me!

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:49.090
Let go!

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.860
How can you say something so morbid?
Asking your own father to kill you.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.300
He's right, Kyung Chae.
I know you're angry,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.530
but you shouldn't say things
like that to your father.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.900
(Mingang Distribution)

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.920
Min Kyung Chae can't get through a day
without her sedatives.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.230
She's always crying, screaming,
and throwing fits.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.960
Why are you telling me this now?

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.030
As a wake-up call.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.470
That lifeline you're clinging to
is about to snap.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.470
So what? You want me to come crawling
to you for help?

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.740
Go on. Try me.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.780
Then I'll decide if you're worth saving.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.380
It's better to swallow
your pride a little...

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.590
than be an outcast with no support,
passed over for promotions,

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.190
and then thrown out.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.660
Wouldn't that be such a tragedy?

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.690
Play your cards right.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.800
Your entire career is in my hands.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.770
You don't want to end up
like Min Kyung Chae.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.830
She took a sedative and just fell asleep.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.300
I've never seen Kyung Chae like this.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.150
I was so shaken up
that I didn't even get to the market.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.480
We'll just have to make do
with what's in the house today.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.890
Just put the side dishes back
in the fridge after you eat.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.430
Nobody remembers my birthday.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.470
(The late Baek Mi So)

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.380
You shouldn't have.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:39.160
Oh, please. Today is a special day.
It's Mi So's birthday!

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.360
When you were in the States,
I took care of it on my own,

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.330
but now our whole family
is finally together again.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.900
It's Mi So's favorite.
Your Auntie's kimchi fried rice and soup.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.540
Happy birthday, my dear Mi So. Eat up!

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.970
Looks like Mi So is...

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.710
getting the royal treatment
from her Aunt Yeon Ah.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:01.980
Come on. It's a happy day.
Don't upset Mi So.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.220
Yeon Ah.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.460
I'm the new CEO.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.020
What?

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.960
For real?

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.530
You're the CEO of Mingang Distribution?

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.170
So you're really the CEO
of that enemy of a company?

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.600
Then you can finally get justice
for Mi So.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.070
Now that company...

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.510
won't be able to just throw
its weight around anymore.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.440
As long as I'm the CEO,

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.910
I will never let it trample
on the powerless.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.090
I'll see you at the office.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.790
Are you okay?

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.960
I have to be.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.860
I have an appointment. I'll be back soon.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.370
Don't you even know what today is?

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:32.970
What's today?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.240
You know what? Nevermind.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.980
You know what I'm going through.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.380
I don't have the energy
to deal with you right now,

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.580
so just stay out of trouble.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.690
She's acting like she owns the place,
walking all over everyone at work.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.030
It's the same way at home.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.030
Are you just going to stand by and watch?

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.170
You think I'm putting up with this
because I want to?

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.000
Isn't this when you should
be doing something, Lawyer Kim?

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.210
With you gone,
I'm not powerful enough on my own.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.780
Even the Board has turned its back on me.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.940
Then you might as well go talk
to Soo Jung.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.450
She's no fan of Lucia either.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.680
You think she'll just take our side,
even as the director?

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.820
She'd have to risk getting
on the chairman's bad side.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.620
So you're saying
there's no way out of this?

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:25.160
Not necessarily.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.330
As long as we have the chairman's will,
we still have a chance.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.290
Because the chairman's will
clearly states...

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.530
that in an emergency,
you are named as the acting Chairman.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:35.900
The way things are now,

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.840
I doubt I'll ever get to be
the acting Chairman.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.670
As long as the will isn't changed,
you'll have an opportunity.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.640
Then you can step
into the Chairman's role...

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.940
and set everything right.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.720
Why are all the stocks
in the distribution industry...

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.190
tanking like this?

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.890
Mingang is holding up,
but something about it seems fishy.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:04.130
Does staring at those darn stocks all day
put food on the table?

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:08.230
What rock have you been living under?
It puts food on the table, and then some.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.400
It can even get us a car.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.300
Have you ever heard
of a stock market tycoon?

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.400
No, I'm saying the CEO was replaced,

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.140
so Mingang will manage to get by somehow.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.140
But we're the ones in serious trouble.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.080
Now that Lucia's the CEO,

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.010
our Ja Kyung's in-law troubles
are going to get even worse.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:27.450
You've got a point.
I wonder how Ji Seop is doing with her.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.820
I think I'll go pay him a visit
and see for myself.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:35.360
Blood is thicker than water.
Why worry about him before your daughter?

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.360
My lovely wife.
You know Ji Seop isn't the brightest bulb.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.630
He's lacking.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.800
He's a big guy,
but he's got nothing between the ears.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.200
Right.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.400
I'm home.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.310
Speak of the devil.
Tae Kyung, the man of the hour.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.140
So, how are things at the company?

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480
The company?

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.010
The new CEO.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.520
He's been here,
worried about that all day.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.420
Our new CEO is doing great.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.920
She just landed a deal
with the Doil Department Store...

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.320
to have our products on their shelves.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.230
Doil Department Store?
One of the top three department stores?

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:14.100
Does that mean Mingang's stock
is going to skyrocket?

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.100
It's not official yet,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.100
but the price should go up soon.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.770
See? I told you! It buys us new cars.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.270
If I make a killing this time,

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.780
I'm going to buy that luxury supercar.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.350
You're just getting home?

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.570
Are you mad at me or something?

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.670
Did I do something wrong?

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:57.510
"Something you did wrong?"

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.140
As if I could ever forget
what you did to my Mi So.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.250
No, it's nothing.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.280
I told you I wasn't the one
who sent that text.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.150
You don't believe me, do you?

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.050
I believe you, so just leave.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.320
- I'm tired.
- Mom!

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.420
That word, "Mom."

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.000
Just for today,
can you please not call me that?

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.370
Why are you being like this?

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.770
It was my birthday today,
but no one remembered.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.100
I'm not that happy either.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.480
Today's your birthday?

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.280
You had no idea, did you?

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:37.610
Figures.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.980
Who would remember a birthday
for someone like me?

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.230
What's with you?

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.960
It's nothing.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.870
You're not going to tell me what's wrong?

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.980
You didn't know it was my birthday
today either, did you?

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.140
Your birthday?

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.680
I swear I remembered it
just a few days ago.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.850
What do you want for a present?

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.450
I wonder if any cake shops are still open.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.290
I'm not a kid asking for things like that.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.160
It just hurts
that everyone in the family forgot.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.590
And what about Lucia?

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.500
That stepmother you adore so much
didn't bother?

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.270
See?

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.570
I told you you mean nothing to that woman.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:37.710
No matter what that woman says or does,
I told you not to fall for her, didn't I?

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.780
How can she and Mi So share a birthday?

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.290
What kind of fate connects these two?

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.760
I guess no one celebrated her birthday.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.400
Listen carefully.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.140
Just because I got fired
doesn't mean this is over.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.310
The company will be mine in the end.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.110
What are you talking about?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.910
If Father can no longer act as chairman,
I'm supposed to take his place.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:20.050
That's what's in the will
that Father wrote with his own two hands.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.690
Do you think Father is going
to live forever?

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:30.060
Once I become the chairman,
that woman will lose her position anyway,

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.630
and she'll be kicked out of this house
without a penny.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.170
As long as the will isn't changed,

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.030
Mingang, this house, and even you...

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.940
will all be mine.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.980
Acting chairman?

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.380
Min Kyung Chae.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.990
So that was your ace
in the hole all along.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:14.170
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.720
Once she takes over as acting chairman,
it's all over.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.920
There are only two ways
to stop Min Kyung Chae.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.090
She thinks if I'm gone, Mingang is hers?

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.590
So that’s what she's thinking.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.660
Do you want to see me go down like this?

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.770
If I go down, so do you, Kim Sun Jae.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.070
There is one way,

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.270
but it'll be
my final, all-or-nothing move.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.570
When is the right time to use this
to deal them a fatal blow?

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.340
I think it's time to make
some revisions to my will.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.850
