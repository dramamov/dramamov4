(The Controlled Lover)

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:32.719
Miss Lu.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.000
Since you joined the Paramount,

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.640
all the nobles and elites
revolve around you.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.640
You really do attract attention.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.479
Miss Gu.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.600
I'm only here for a while.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.119
I have no intention
of competing with you.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.679
Once I finish what I came to do,

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.000
all the glory here

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.840
will belong to you.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.640
The famous jeweler,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.439
Mr. Jing Haisi
is waiting for you in the private room.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.719
You should go meet him.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.120
Lu Huayan.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.439
Miss Gu.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.040
I wonder if our great star

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.200
would grace me with a drink.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.239
How could I refuse
Young Master Jiang's invitation?

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.959
All right.

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:39.239
So the Mei pearl is with you.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.799
Miss Lu.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:45.040
Mei pearl?

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:46.480
What Mei pearl?

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.439
Mr. Jing.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.599
What are you trying to do?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.719
Of course, kill you.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.120
And take the Mei pearl.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.239
The Mei pearl protects its master?

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.879
The game has begun.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.319
Gu Meng. Where is Gu Meng?

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:37.759
Kill her!

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.520
Help!

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.520
Help!

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.800
Save me!

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.879
Save me!

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.960
Run!

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.479
How could this be?

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:13.560
Murder!

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.759
Murder!

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.319
Run!

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.879
Murder!

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.479
(The Mei pearl can control its host.)

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.360
How exciting.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.759
Get out.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.280
Murder!

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.360
Help!

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.719
Murder!

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.080
(You're truly obsessed with her.)

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:55.599
Do you

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.280
like me?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.960
(It's the Mei pearl's backlash.)

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600
(Li Motong,)

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.079
(you must not fall for her.)

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.879
(No. You can't.)

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.680
It's your turn now.

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:05.120
(Jing Haisi,)

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.879
(it's you again.)

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.519
Young Master Jiang, why are you here?

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:29.959
Lu Huayan's gone mad!

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:30.839
She's trying to kill me!

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:32.079
She's trying to kill me!

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:36.279
Calm down, Young Master Jiang.

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:37.639
Let me help you sit and rest.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.160
We can talk it over slowly.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.480
Hurry, go!

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.279
It wasn't me.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.920
Yes.

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.439
Lu Huayan.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.519
You're a murderer.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.959
You're a murderer!

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:09.680
Lu Huayan's a killer! Lu Huayan!

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.319
You're awake.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.600
Where is this?

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:22.439
My home.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.040
I brought you back from the Paramount.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.800
That Mr. Jing...

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.319
Why did he try to kill me?

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.160
Jing Haisi.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.319
He's my half-brother.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.040
He wanted to kill you

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.839
because the Mei pearl is in you.

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:41.560
Why am I caught up in your world?

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.560
Wujian draws power from two sources,

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.600
the Chi pearl and the Mei pearl.

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:48.639
The Chi pearl has returned to Wujian,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.360
but the Mei pearl remains within you.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.959
The reason you can see spirit beasts

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.319
is because of it.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.720
So?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.959
What about my sister then?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.920
She died because of it too,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.720
didn't she?

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.920
You from Wujian

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.720
treat human life like ants.

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.399
So our lives and deaths
mean nothing to you, is that it?

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:16.720
Whatever the case,

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.560
you still need to heal your wounds.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.639
As a cold-blooded man of Wujian,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.199
you're pretending
to show me kindness now?

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.720
What if the goodwill
of the Lord of Wujian

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.199
is a trap?

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:30.839
I can't afford that.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.319
Hand over Lu Huayan.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.360
Give me Lu Huayan!

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.160
Miss Lu.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.720
My brother just died in the Paramount.

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:03.519
Someone saw you
having a fierce quarrel with him,

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:05.240
and stabbing him with a knife.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:07.959
Was it you who killed my brother?

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.959
Commander Jiang,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.759
if you have evidence,
then arrest and question me.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.240
If you don't,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.959
are you just abusing your power?

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:20.160
This was found at the crime scene.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.759
A dancer
in the Paramount swore it's yours.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.240
Lu Huayan,

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.959
you can't deny it.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.440
This earring

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.840
is indeed mine.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:34.879
But

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.960
I absolutely didn't kill him.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.960
I don't care whether you did or not.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.279
If you're a suspect, you deserve death.

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:42.639
In Ye City,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.600
I, Jiang Mingfeng,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.960
kill whoever I wish.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.799
Quite the arrogance, Commander Jiang.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.159
You must be the inspector, Li Motong.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.820
Since Commander Jiang
thinks so highly of yourself,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.960
why not shoot?

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:13.559
Kill me too.

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:37.559
Get out of here.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.720
Why did you help me again?

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.799
What trick are you playing this time?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.720
I just want you to live.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:02.519
This medicine

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:05.639
can ease the pain
caused by the Mei pearl's backlash.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.240
Take it.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.240
Are you all right?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.799
Did Jiang Mingfeng give you
any trouble just now?

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.080
Take Miss Lu home.

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:20.919
All right.

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.360
Miss Lu.

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.360
Yan.

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:36.039
You accepted the medicine I gave you.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.360
Does that mean

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.320
you've forgiven me?

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.440
Mr. Gu, why haven't you
started the car yet?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.639
Miss Lu.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.759
Actually,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.639
our boss isn't a bad person.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.799
Don't be so hostile toward him.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.600
It's not just him I'm hostile to.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:58.000
I'm hostile to everyone from Wujian.

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:00.159
If you won't drive,

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.960
I'll get out.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.039
All right.
