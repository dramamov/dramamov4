00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.600
Let's go to Mr. Chen's house. Okay.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.800
and apologize.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.400
Then finish what you should do.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.520
To keep my job,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.680
to keep my job.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.280
Shouldn't you think about

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.840
if it's your problem.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.880
We are ordinary people.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.400
We can't offend them.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.240
Jin-kyung.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.039
We need to control the cost.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.440
What cost?

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.760
feed fee.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.040
Don't hit me.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.120
Don't hit me. I was wrong.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.640
Don't hit me. I'm so good.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.680
Let me give you a massage.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.919
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.919
Do you need our help?

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.840
It's a matter of mutual love.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.680
Why are you yelling?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.800
Finish what you haven't done.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.200
That's all in the past.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.840
I'm just talking nonsense.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.640
But who do you think others prefer to trust?

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.680
Mr Chen, it's on me this time.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.320
Iâ€™ll give you a younger and prettier one next time.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.200
It is said that Dacheng Firm has resigned

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.920
Song Yue and Xu Jia Jia.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.600
All companies related to this case

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.680
[who are related to this case.]

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.920
[has been suspended]

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.400
mentioned in the recording

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.800
to be investigated.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.600
Thank you.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.600
We're not outsiders.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.600
What are you doing?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.120
We're old friends.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.320
Lu Jinjing.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.160
What are you going to do next?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.760
Go back to your hometown first.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.480
Although it's done,

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.840
I've become the blacklist of the industry.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.800
But I don't regret it.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.320
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.560
To be honest,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.600
You asked me why I did this last time.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.240
Yes.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.320
It is said that

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.240
the first Heavenly Queen Mother was in charge of the Criminal Law.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.520
When someone

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.040
that cannot be cleared,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.240
she will be punished.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.040
and punish the sins and injustice in the mortal world.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.480
So you're doing this to become her?

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.000
Not just me.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.880
We're both...

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.120
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.840
I didn't make myself clear last time.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.440
The real reason I'm interested in you is

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.040
I saw the fire in your heart.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.040
It's the flame of ideal.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.080
The fire of faith.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.480
It may still be a little flame now.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.320
but it can light up those who need help.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.080
I saw it.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.760
You'll see it one day.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.440
I'm different from you.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.280
I'm not as good as you.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.440
Everyone here

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.840
step by step.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.840
No one is born to be strong.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.960
They all need to work hard the day after tomorrow

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.480
step by step.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.040
Jinjing.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.760
Look at your best friend Wang Yu.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.120
What was she like before?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.200
But now,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.240
confident, strong, and brave.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.240
I trust you.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.600
Before you grow up,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.400
we will protect you.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.720
So...

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.600
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.680
Are you interested in finding a new job?

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.280
Or are you interested in joining us

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.200
and light this fire together?

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.240
Hello, I'm Lu Jin-kyung.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.480
Nice to meet you.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.200
My sister and I never had a mother.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.200
My dad died early too.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.720
Uncle said he was drunk

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.040
and got hit by a car.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.440
My sister and I weren't very sad.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.600
We all thought

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.240
we finally said goodbye to

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.080
who doesn't care about us.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.760
But unexpectedly,

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:53.240
this is the beginning of a nightmare.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.400
I've never seen my uncle

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.400
and never returned to my hometown.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.440
Later I found out

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.520
we were sold

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.040
to that man.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.960
Hu Qiang.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.480
Are you done?

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.440
Okay, got it.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.960
Okay, let's go.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.680
Okay.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.800
Thank you.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.080
What a bad luck to take this case in the morning.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.520
There's no case in this world.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:34.600
What's going on?

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.000
Kidnapping, looking for my sister.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.720
The case ten years ago.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.320
He went missing last month.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.240
Ten years ago?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.080
Do you really want to take this case?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.160
Qin Shan.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.480
Boss.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.000
Well...

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:52.920
Abduction.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.160
Hu Li.
