Clean it.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.079
I'll clean it for you.

00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:49.240
I didn't know you offered this service.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200
Customer is queen.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.560
Madam, are you awake?

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.480
(What?)

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.359
(It's him.)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.280
Drink up!

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.540
You lost again.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.319
Bottoms up!

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.200
(I barely drink any.)

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.799
(Why do I feel so wasted?)

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.239
(I should get freshened up.)

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.920
Shi Yue, where are you?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.959
What's my glasses doing here?

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.159
Come on! Drink up!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400
Come on.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.479
Hurry.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.360
Have a drink.

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:18.800
You call this a drink?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.919
Get a bigger shot!

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:24.719
Drink up.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:25.520

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.360
Another one.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:32.639
I caught you.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:34.599
Glasses thief.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.159
Pretty lady, you got it all wrong.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.400
These are my glasses.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.280
These are your glasses.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.680
Come on!

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.599
Same model. It must be fate.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.319
Have a drink.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.360
Let's be friends.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.280
What fate?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.800
Is she your client?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.439
You'd rather drink with her and not me?

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.280
(Client?)

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.240
Excuse me.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.080
Carry on.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280
Why are you leaving?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.919
Forget her.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.800
Come on.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.680
I'll drink with you.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.960
Where were you just now?

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.960
The restroom.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.560
Come on.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.639
Here.

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.319
Drink up!

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.680
Come on!

(Drinking Wine, Dancing Night)

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.120
Not bad.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.240
Another shot!

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.840
(The youngsters' flirting skills
are less than underwhelming these days.)

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.199
(What a joke.)

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.639
(Did he)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.439
(just call me his client?)

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.199
Had a nice sleep?

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.240
Hmm?

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.039
Do you really have to stare at me?

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.319
Breakfast is ready.

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.879
(Oh my.)

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.639
(This can't be more wrong.)

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.680
(How did I end up with a host?)

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.866
Over there.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.199
(Of the 36 strategies,)

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.240
(fleeing is the sound one.)

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.839
It's not much to borrow an outfit.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.519
My shirt got dirty.

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:34.480
I need to borrow this.

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:36.000
Certainly, Madam.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:39.879
Are you

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:40.879
actually

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.839
the host?

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.439
How do you know?

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:49.240
But I don't like that title here.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:50.519
You may call me Lu Xingchen.

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.519
The outfit looks good on you.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.639
I'll pay up at the club.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.720
Consider this outfit bought.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.160
Don't get wasted if you can't handle it.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.279
And how would you make money
if people don't drink?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.199
We don't make a lot selling alcohol.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480
What we sell

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040
is the service package.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.639
It's not worth flexing.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.800
Satisfying every client

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.920
is our motto.

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:21.160
(He seems proud of his job.)

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.000
Why do I get this feeling

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.920
that you look familiar?

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.888
Is this the typical playboy troupe?

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720
So frosty.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.777
Someone broke your heart?

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:39.040
You keep your clients' info
confidential, right?

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:43.439
Certainly.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.466
The door is over there.

00:05:48.488 --> 00:05:49.555
Sorry.

You didn't even answer my calls.

to take you
to pick out your suit for the party.

00:09:11.222 --> 00:09:12.066
I'm not going.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.619

will be full of elites.

Anyway,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.960
from now on, all matters of you
taking over Xinghan Group

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:48.679
will be handled by me.

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:52.759
Mr. Mo, you really are dedicated.

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:55.840
I've passed on the message.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.320
There is work to be done.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.120
I'll go now.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.333
I'm not scolding you.

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:11.879
Mr. Xingchen, a message for you.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.440
(Shi Yue: Xingchen,)

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.840
(news of your dad remarrying)

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.519
(is all over town now.)

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.720
The address for the fitting...

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.080
Did he leave it?

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.600
He did, Mr. Xingchen.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.120
Take me there later.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.759
Alright.

00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:32.559
(So eager to invite me?)

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.377
(I'll go meet this gold digger myself.)

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.980
(Lu Jianhua and Tang Baozhu)

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.000
Mr. Li.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.399
Mr. Lu.

00:10:46.177 --> 00:10:47.080
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

00:10:47.088 --> 00:10:47.822
Please come inside.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:50.679
Mr. Lu.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.159
Did Xingchen get the notice?

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.759
Yeah, he did.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.480
That kid has been running wild abroad.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.639
Now that he is back,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.279
you'll need to teach him some manners.

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.759
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.711
I'll make sure he learns.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:08.799
Mr. Lu.

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:09.389
Hello.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.239
Congratulations.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.133
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:12.800
- Please come inside.
- Alright, let's go.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.088
The preparations were rushed.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.320
I've explained everything.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:45.240
A cynical rich kid, huh?

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:46.440
I'm basically

00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:48.120
just playing myself, right?

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:50.840
Our mission is...

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.133
To take down the gold digger.

00:11:52.155 --> 00:11:53.200
Our goal is...

00:11:53.288 --> 00:11:54.311
To seduce Tang Baozhu.

00:11:54.355 --> 00:11:55.679
I memorized her dress design.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.550
We'll act accordingly.

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:57.039
Okay.

00:11:57.039 --> 00:11:57.440
Let's go.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.200
Mr. Xingchen.

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:02.399
There are a lot of guests tonight.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.039
Be sure to behave properly.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:06.360
What are you, a cop?

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:07.279
Don't be nosy.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.440
When does the party start?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.840
In about...

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.360
Half an hour.

00:12:20.622 --> 00:12:21.270
Congratulations.

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:22.639
Thanks for coming today.

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:24.840
You look absolutely stunning.

00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:27.000
Bestie.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.399
Bestie!

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:30.679
You finally made it!

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.000
Of course I'd come.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.080
If I didn't, someone else
would've stolen my bestie.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.799
No way that would happen.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.279
Are you here for my wedding

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.399
or to mourn me?

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.279
What are you saying?

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:43.720
Touch wood.

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:44.720
Don't jinx it.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.279
I have another dress.

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:47.279
Go change into it.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.720
Tang Baozhu.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.933
You're the one getting engaged,

00:12:49.933 --> 00:12:52.080
so why should I steal the spotlight?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.400
It's fine. I like it this way.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.133
Bestie.

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:56.399
Did you forget our childhood promise?

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:59.919
We said we'd be the prettiest ones
at each other's engagement party.

00:13:00.622 --> 00:13:01.720
I look pretty good, don't I?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.733
Go on, hurry!

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.039
Alright, alright.

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:04.720
Where is it?

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.440
Over there.

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:07.519
Quick, go.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.377
The black widow style,
with the pearl gown.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.919
She is the one.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:16.919
Tang Baozhu.

00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:18.759
I won't allow you to marry Lu Jianhua!

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:19.879
I am in love with you!

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.720
(They are here for Baozhu?)

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:32.039
What are you doing here?
