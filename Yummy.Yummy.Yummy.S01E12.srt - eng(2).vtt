00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.840
(Capital Prefecture)

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.780
Coming, coming.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.280
Come on.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.810
Come on, eat up.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.200
Help yourselves.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.140
Sure.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.740
Here, Mr. Lin.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.310
I've been busy sorting out the markets.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.660
I'll need your cooperation.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.790
I'll try to give you some allowance.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.680
Mr. Lin,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.410
it's our duty to work hard.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.710
No need for allowance, right?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.970
- Exactly.
- Yes.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.150
It's settled then.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.100
No need to decline.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.290
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.020
Mr. Lin.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.850
Greetings.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.780
I didn't expect you

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.250
to still be working
on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.030
Duty calls.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.030
We can't afford to delay.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.630
But today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.100
You should relax a bit.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.750
The osmanthus flowers are in full bloom.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.080
Her Highness has sent me

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.570
to invite you to appreciate

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.230
the flowers and taste the wine.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.680
Thanks for her concern,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.860
but I can't leave my post.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.950
I'm afraid I can't go.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.300
Once this period is over,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.300
I'll visit her in person to apologize.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.580
In that case,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.300
I won't disturb you further.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.300
Goodbye.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.380
If I'm not mistaken,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.940
this is the third time

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.820
the Princess has invited Mr. Lin, right?

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.060
Don't meddle.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.180
What's wrong?

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.380
Mr. Lin is so handsome.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.500
If I were a young lady,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.860
I'd like someone like him, too.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.820
Right?

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.760
Yes.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.180
Hu.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.500
Don't get me started.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.060
If you were a young lady,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.220
how fierce you'd be.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.020
How could Mr. Lin like you?

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.140
What? He might happen to like my type.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.060
Right, Mr. Lin?

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.660
What's so funny?

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.380
Auntie, you're here.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.900
Come on.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.660
I've prepared some mooncakes for you.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.140
Come on, taste them.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.020
Open it.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.980
Let's take a look.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.020
There are jujube paste fillings,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.860
osmanthus fillings,

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.340
and even bean paste fillings.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.300
Take the one

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.460
you like.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.260
This is my daughter's idea.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.540
She calls this Mooncake Fortune.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.660
It's like drawing lots

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.060
for divination in the temple.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.300
Once you get a mooncake,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.080
it's like you've drawn your own fortune.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.380
The outside is the fortune text,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.820
and the inside is the interpretation.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.300
How clever.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.820
The moon rises bright;

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.940
the belle is so fair.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.980
Whoever has this mooncake

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.180
will surely find a fine wife.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.140
A fine wife.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.900
A fine wife.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.460
Listen.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.680
Though Mr. Lin just came here,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.300
the line of ladies who want to marry him

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.060
could stretch
from the east end of the city

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.740
all the way to the west.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.980
- Of course.
- Mr. Lin.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.460
I have a question.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.940
What kind of girl do you like?

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.180
Tell us.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.300
Mr. Lin is so talented.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.700
He even deserves

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.860
a heavenly fairy.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.500
Tell us.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.300
Come on, tell us.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.460
Tell us, Mr. Lin.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.660
Mr. Lin, I'm also curious.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.500
What kind

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.060
of girl do you like?

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.820
Tell us, Mr. Lin.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.020
Tell us.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.380
Why look at me?

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.740
Do you like someone like me?

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.900
Stop talking nonsense.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.740
You...

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.340
How dare you joke about Mr. Lin?

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.540
It's the festival. Just a joke.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.660
Just a joke.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.110
Eat up.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.100
(You'll find a fine wife)
Let me introduce this.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.820
There must be

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.180
good fortune inside.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.100
(Capital Prefecture)

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.540
As you instructed,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.900
I've let the officials

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.500
go home early for their holidays.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.820
The reorganization affairs

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.940
will be handled after the festival.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.020
Young Master,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.580
let's go home and rest.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.260
Liu Chang,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.420
since I took office,

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.060
I've been doing my best

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.620
as the Vice Prefect.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.540
(Qingyang Cui Case)
I've read this file many times.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.300
All the proof confirmed Father's guilt.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.940
Up to now,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.180
I haven't made any progress.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.020
This old case is so complicated

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.580
that it's hard to sort out.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.540
Young Master,

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.260
we've waited for so many years.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
We don't need to rush.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.860
I understand.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.140
Liu Chang,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.620
you go back to Yunshui Manor.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.180
You can still catch a hot meal.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.020
Young Master,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.540
today is a holiday. You can't...

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.500
Go back first.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.420
Come back early.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.180
(31 criminals from Qingyang
were executed.)

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.260
Father,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.580
the dishes are cleared.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.060
- Take it easy.
- Come home early

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.620
and make mooncakes for me.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.060
Okay.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.580
Today,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.740
let's close the stall early.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.980
Let's go home

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.980
and celebrate the festival.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.140
Alright, Father.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.240
I want sweet sesame fillings

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.980
for my mooncake.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.940
Okay.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.500
(Yunshui Manor)

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.420
(East Kitchen)

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.980
Dad, is this delicious?

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.660
Yes.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.940
- Auntie.
- Try it.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.340
How does the next line go?

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.020
Fragrant on the branches with grace,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.660
jasmines are loved by everyone.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.140
Oh, you're still busy.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.340
My young master

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.740
is still busy with work.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.680
No need to prepare dinner for him.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.520
Alright.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.980
Okay, I know.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.340
What an attitude.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.900
You don't even care
about my young master.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.140
How heartless.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.500
Liu Chang.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.900
Wait.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.940
Wait.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.000
Wait.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.100
Wait.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.980
(Qingyang Cui Case)

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.300
(Deal with it swiftly
to serve as a warning.)

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.020
Taste it and see how it is.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.020
Thanks, dear.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.940
One for Father.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.020
One for Mother.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.020
Thanks.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.020
One for me.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.300
Che, good boy.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.860
This piece is particularly good,

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.340
with layers of fat and lean meat.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.860
Give it to Che first.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.740
Father is serving this to Mother.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.100
I'm not eating it.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.420
Auntie, I made this mooncake.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.860
So impressive.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.580
You must let Mr. Lin try it.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.100
Mr. Lin.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.020
- Mr. Lin.
- Stop working.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.980
- Come.
- Come and eat.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.920
Today is a festival.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.360
Let's all gather together.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.660
You can continue after dinner.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.260
Young Master, come on.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.500
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin, come.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.900
There are so many delicious dishes.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.100
Come on, Mr. Lin.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.460
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.600
to Mr. Lin

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.820
and Mr. Liu Chang.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.860
Let's do it together.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.886
Come on, come on.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.620
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.180
Yangyang is so smart and clever.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.500
If I had a daughter like you,

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.340
I'd pick that round moon

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.620
and give it to you.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.620
Don't worry.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.900
You'll have it sooner or later.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.860
Is that so?

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.180
Come on, Mr. Lin.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.540
Have some chicken wings.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.500
Eat up.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.420
- Try it.
- Here.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.380
Thanks.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.140
Alright, try it.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.020
Here, Yangyang.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.020
What are you doing?

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.460
Your neck...

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.140
Go that way.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.380
Come on.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.780
We'll never part this way.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.020
Yangyang.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.820
Come on, Yangyang.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.680
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.900
Alright.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.180
Here, Yangyang.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.140
Have some vegetables.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.500
Here, Yangyang.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.700
Let me serve you some of this.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.300
Is there something on Mr. Lin's mind?

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.140
At this festival,

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.420
families should be together.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.060
My young master just misses his family.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.020
Liu Chang,

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.460
eat.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:07.980
So delicious.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.260
Father, Mother,

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.340
when Grandpa...

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.140
Grandfather passed away,

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.900
Gongcai and I were also sad.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.020
We remember.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.340
You were too young at that time.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.380
You couldn't understand why

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.580
you'd never see Grandfather again.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.540
Then

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.660
you lied to us

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.100
and said that when people die,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.600
they become stars in the sky

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.000
and watch over us forever.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.180
Jicai exposed it on the spot,

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.540
saying that stars are just stars

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.100
and they are not people at all.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.420
Mr. Lin,

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.660
sorry about this.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.900
Jicai has loved reading books

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.260
since she was young.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.420
She's not gullible.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.300
So, her father and I

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.900
had to tell her the truth.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.180
You see,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.620
when people die,

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.780
they are gone.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:50.940
Those words are

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.700
made up for the living.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.220
But the deceased

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.860
must've loved you very much.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.740
They wouldn't want

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.860
their departure to cause you pain.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.380
Instead, they'd hope

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.140
that you live happily every day.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.140
Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.100
You must be happy

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.780
every day.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.740
Indeed.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.210
Thank you.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.100
Fengxia and I

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.780
have never had any disagreements.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.060
You doing so well

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.620
nowadays

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.340
is all thanks

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.620
to your mother.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.980
Ever since the day you married me,

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.220
I knew

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.660
I had a good wife.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.260
I was not wrong.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.500
You have no idea.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.620
Back then, we were poor.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.060
I could only give her 2,500 a month.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.060
With just that meager amount,

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.440
your mother

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.500
managed the entire household's expenses,

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.820
from food to clothing.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.380
That's when I knew

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.780
I had a wife

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.260
who'd stick with me

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.420
through thick and thin.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.420
I'll drink to you.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.380
Fengxia,

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.340
I love you.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.620
Come on.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.820
So, you chose

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.380
to be with me

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.620
because I could manage

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.940
to keep the household in order

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.180
with your meager wage,

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.140
right?

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.100
No.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:15.900
You've got it wrong.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.340
What I mean is

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.940
that even when we were so poor,

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.820
your mother still loved me.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.820
It's different now.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.940
Now,

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.660
we have money.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.140
It's different from back then.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.020
Look at your mother,

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.100
with the headdress

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.960
like a cockscomb

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.340
and those

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.540
expensive robes.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.460
They're pricey.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.420
Dad.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.900
I bought these headdresses

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.820
and robes with my own money.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:37.940
What's it to you?

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.980
With your own money? I don't think so.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.900
Of course, that's my money.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.220
Who's been in the kitchen,

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.200
cooking all the dishes

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.660
- one by one?
- Stop them.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.340
Frying, roasting, boiling,
stir-frying, steaming, and grilling.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.740
I've done it all.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.820
Aren't you ashamed at all?

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.420
Pork, stir-fried dishes.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.340
All these ideas were from Jicai.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.300
Grandma.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.260
Plus, people here haven't tasted

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.100
those dishes before.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.660
It has nothing to do with you.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.700
You've changed a lot.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.720
I never looked down on you

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.140
when you were poor.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.620
At least you were down-to-earth
and humble.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.500
Look how arrogant you've become.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.420
Let the kids see

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.740
how arrogant you've become.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.780
Grandma.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.340
You just can't stand to see me do well.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.920
You can't bear to see me show my talent.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.660
Why?

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.580
Because you're not making progress.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.900
You're jealous.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.380
Jealous?

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.220
Dad.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.260
That's right.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.220
Shen Jianshe,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.860
you really crack me up.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.460
I'm losing my teeth from laughing.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.330
What's the matter?

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.640
I can't stand to see you do well?

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.760
I'm not making progress?

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.460
Fine.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.820
Let's get a divorce.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.180
Find a woman who thinks you're great.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.380
- Mom.
- Grandma.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.540
It's okay.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.140
How can you say such things

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.220
on the Mid-Autumn Festival?

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:45.900
It's so unlucky.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.540
When we got married, I told you

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.740
that no matter what,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.940
no matter who's right or wrong,

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.300
we should never talk about divorce.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.100
Don't be impulsive. Let's talk it out.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.440
Tell your mom

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.500
to take those words back.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.800
I'll pretend I didn't hear them.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.900
Why should I take them back?

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.820
Why shouldn't you?

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.180
You can hear it or not.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.340
Uncle, Auntie.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.500
Calm down.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.740
What are you trying to do?

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.260
What do you want?

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.340
What are you doing?

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.180
Are you serious?

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.220
Are you serious about it?

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.420
What? Rolling up your sleeves?

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.780
- Are you...?
- Trying to hit me?

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.340
If you want a divorce, fine.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.500
Divorce it is.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.700
Uncle, Auntie.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.620
- Uncle.
- Uncle.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.480
Yangyang, don't cry.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.860
Divorce is serious.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.580
Don't rush into it
just because of pride.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.780
It's not about pride.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.780
Today is a festival.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.660
It's not easy for us to gather here.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.020
Listen to what she said.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.700
What did you say?

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.460
- Yangyang.
- Try to be the reasonable one?

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.340
Yangyang, stop crying.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.540
Don't cry, don't cry.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.660
Come on, go back with me.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.540
Don't cry, good girl.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.500
Where are you going?

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.820
Leave.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.400
Don't come back.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.660
Go sleep at the diner.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.540
Mom.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.700
Fine, I won't go back.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.580
I'm not the same Shen Jianshe as before.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.540
Why all of a sudden...?

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.580
I...

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.660
Dad, Dad.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.060
Who am I?

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.420
I'm the Best Chef in Yong'an.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.460
Liu Chang,

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.420
keep an eye on things.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.380
What are you doing?

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.620
Mother.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.260
Are we still having dinner?

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.620
Yangyang.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.510
Mother.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.740
Don't be angry.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.380
I'm sorry.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.740
I ruined

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.260
a perfectly good evening.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.380
I wanted to celebrate
the festival with you,

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.980
but instead, I made a fool of myself.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.020
Do you think

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.700
that I'm just your landlord

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.660
because you live in my house?

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:29.700
Or do you think

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.180
that I'm someone you should cling to

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.860
because you run a business

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.260
in Juxian Alley

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.300
and I'm the Vice Prefect?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.580
No, absolutely not.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.460
We consider you as family.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.500
I do, too.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.340
You knew my identity issue.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.580
It'll be fine if no one finds out,

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.640
but if someone does,
you'll be committing a crime.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.060
You didn't use this to get
any benefits from me.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.980
Instead, you took care of me

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.980
and comforted me.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.700
You accepted my shortcomings.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.340
Why would you think

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.860
that I'd enjoy

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.340
your parents' quarrel?

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.740
It's not that.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.380
It's my problem.

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.540
I thought it was a joke.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.940
Mr. Lin, can I treat you as a tree hole?

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.940
Separated by a screen,

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.620
you're not the Vice Prefect anymore.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.780
You're my tree hole.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.900
Tree hole?

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:36.820
Am I

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:38.580
a hole

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.940
in a tree?

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.980
No.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.980
A tree hole means

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.020
that you're someone

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.220
I can confide my secrets and worries to,

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.500
someone I can trust.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.460
I see.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.140
Before coming to Yong'an,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.320
our family business wasn't doing well.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.300
Mother took on a lot.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.620
Father couldn't earn much money,

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.260
but he was very good to us.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.540
But after coming to Yong'an,

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.020
Father's dishes became popular.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.820
He changed a bit.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.260
He often quarreled with Mother.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.190
I knew

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.100
that this would lead to problems,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.740
but I wanted to pretend
nothing had happened.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.180
Just now, I didn't think

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.500
that you'd enjoy this.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.900
It's my problem.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.340
I thought they acted improperly,

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.900
but they are my parents.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.660
How could I be so selfish
and despicable?

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.860
In everything,

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.140
we judge actions, not intentions.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.900
You haven't done anything

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.140
to hurt others.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.820
Thoughts are just thoughts.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.700
You're not trying to become a saint.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.420
Why be so hard on yourself?

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.360
Now, you're just a tree hole.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.560
You can't comment.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.660
Sorry.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.220
I know

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:03.780
even if I had the thought

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.500
that they acted improperly,

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.660
maybe they also had moments

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.540
when they felt burdened by me.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.700
But none of that matters.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.020
What matters is that we are a family.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.980
We'll never abandon each other.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.220
Before, I thought

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.660
that my family was so unlucky

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.980
that there couldn't be
any ancestral protection.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.580
But now I know:

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.660
Someone's been protecting us all along.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.500
Thanks.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.820
Can the tree hole speak now?

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.940
The tree hole can't speak,

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.060
but Mr. Lin can.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.460
Actually,

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.940
I haven't done much.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.140
A family stuck together

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.820
can achieve anything.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.540
Maybe I can also be your tree hole.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.820
Do you have any troubles?

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.060
Thanks for your comfort

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.580
just now at dinner.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.980
Actually,

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.900
on every occasion

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.940
when families should be together,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.940
I feel very guilty.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.180
Shaoguang,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.020
my parents

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.140
were not criminals.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.220
My father used to be the Prefect.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.020
He dedicated himself to the people,

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.860
but he was framed.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.060
I changed

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.020
my name

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.580
and became the Vice Prefect,

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.700
yet I've achieved nothing.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.260
I really don't know

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.220
what qualifications
I have to enjoy myself

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.580
or exist in this world.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.570
♪Wear a sunset glow upon the brow♪

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.810
♪Breeze sways,

♪Hear one chime ring,

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.460
Don't think that way.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.540
Human capabilities are limited.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.140
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.020
If your parents were still alive,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.500
they'd definitely want to see you happy

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.780
on every festival and every day.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.300
Enjoyment and existence

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.620
don't need qualifications.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.900
You just have to enjoy.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.080
You just need to be happy.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.300
We ruined your dinner,

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.300
so I prepared
a mixed nuts mooncake for you.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.700
Mixed nuts?

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.380
Give it a try.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.860
I've never had such a mooncake.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:29.980
Let me try it.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.900
It's delicious.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.540
I didn't expect you

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.420
to appreciate this filling.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.780
Are many people

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.260
not fond of this filling?

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.220
More than that.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.580
In the Future Village,

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.140
mooncake lovers
will be divided into two camps.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.260
One side supports this filling,

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.140
while the other thinks

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.220
this filling is extremely bad.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.380
This issue can even

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.060
make friends fall out.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.340
In my family,
I'm the only one who's fond of it.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:06.900
This year,

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.140
at the spring equinox,

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.180
Yong'an also had a heated argument.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.380
The scholars debated

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.660
whether a pottery pillow

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.500
or a wooden pillow was more elegant,

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.180
and they filled a whole wall

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.660
of Guixiang Tavern with poems,

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.620
insulting each other.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.140
What's the point of that?

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.820
Then I'll present you

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.820
with a cotton pillow
from the Future Village.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.260
It's better than those.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.500
It's soft to sleep on,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.420
not cold in winter,

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.620
and good for the neck bones.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.500
But my sewing skills aren't good.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.860
My mother is best at this.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.940
Your parents

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.940
are reasonable people.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.620
They will talk it out.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.580
Now, I think

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.700
you're really

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.300
like my friend.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.820
But for me,

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.620
you should be revered,

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.500
and I can never

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.980
disrespect you.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.940
I

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.420
can't be disrespected?

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.220
Do you still

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.580
feel that way now?

(Yunshui Manor)

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.540
I'm so sorry. I'll never dare again.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.420
Last night,

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:23.300
after getting drunk,

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.180
I offended

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.380
the man I respect the most.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.000
I deserve to be killed and sent to hell.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.320
I'm sorry to my family and you.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.000
I'm so sorry. I'll never drink again.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.900
Lady Shen,

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.060
what happened last night?

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:42.580
I don't remember.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.260
I remember

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.020
we ate mooncakes together.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.540
I became a tree hole,

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.420
and then

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.540
we drank wine together.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.140
After that,

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.580
I can't remember clearly.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.780
Did something bad happen?

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.340
You don't remember?

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:03.900
You just said

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.980
you're sorry to your family

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.020
and me.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.660
What did you do?

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.460
Nothing, nothing.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.620
I shouldn't have let you

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.500
drink so much wine.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.500
If it delays your duties today,

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.010
that'd be my fault.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.700
Just for that?

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.300
Why did you kneel to me?

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:28.740
Well.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.980
I feel alcohol

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.220
is the source of all evil.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.060
There aren't
many good officials like you.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.500
Yet I dragged you into drinking.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.300
I really should repent.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.660
I'll go and make you some sobering soup.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.900
You're sick.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.060
Oh, I'm having a fever.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.900
It's okay; this is retribution.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.420
I'll make some sobering soup for you.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.220
You're sick.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.380
You're ill.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.580
I deserve this. It's my retribution.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.400
Sorry.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.820
Wait a minute.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.300
What are you doing?

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:46.820
Come on.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.420
Mr. Lin.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.020
I can't take it.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.260
I'm not feeling well.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.860
I can't go into your room.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.220
I'll call your family first

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.500
and find a physician for you.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:03.980
I don't mind.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.540
Why are you suddenly

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.220
concerned about the boundaries?

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.340
Because of the curfew,

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.740
we even spent a night in the diner.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.500
What's wrong?

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.420
Well.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.700
I should care.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.260
You often say things

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.660
that others don't understand.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.740
It's nothing serious.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.140
However,

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.500
in some word choices,

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.460
you should

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.380
be more cautious.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.060
Take a rest.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.660
(Clear and Bright)

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.460
How could the fever get so bad?

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.020
Jicai,

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.060
do you feel unwell?

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.100
We can't even

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.340
find cold medicine here.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.780
What should we do?

00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.580
What to do?

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.780
It's also your fault, dear.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.620
You insisted

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.940
that I sleep at the diner.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.140
As soon as I left home,

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.380
our daughter got sick.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.580
What should we do?

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.700
What to do?

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.580
Stop pretending to be anxious.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.020
Go ask your ancestor

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.860
if the physician's medicine is ready.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.940
Don't cover her like this.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.100
She'll get hot.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.500
Don't do that.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.020
She needs to sweat now.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.140
We have to cover her up.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.020
If you uncover her,
she'll catch a cold again.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.220
Do you know?
Secondary colds can be very serious.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.220
In this era,
the mortality rate is quite high.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.180
Do you know?

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.260
Can't you say something good?

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.940
This is not conducive to cooling down.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.540
Your method is not scientific at all.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.420
Do you know?

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.820
Nagging all day long.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.670
When I was a child,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.640
that's how it was done.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.460
Stop all that.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.300
Enough, stop arguing.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.540
Jicai is already unwell.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.420
With the quarreling,

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.660
she'll be even more upset.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:47.820
But

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.580
what if it's not a cold?

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.620
She ate three boxes

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.420
of mixed nuts mooncakes yesterday.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.740
Maybe she's got heat in her body.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.580
Three boxes?

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.430
Why eat so many?

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.640
Are you a hoarder or something?

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.140
Your illness

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.080
is not strange at all.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.220
Dad,

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.780
can you just keep quiet?

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.540
It's not about that.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.460
I'm being punished.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.420
What?

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.340
What did she say?

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.020
I said I ate three boxes of mooncakes.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:16.980
I deserve this.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.220
You absolutely deserve it.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.300
You ate so much.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.060
Can you stop talking?

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.420
The medicine is here.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.840
- Come on.
- The medicine is here.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.800
Come on.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.220
Come on, Jicai.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.180
Take your medicine.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.540
Take it, and you'll get better.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.380
I won't drink it. It's too bitter.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.780
- Good girl.
- Can I not drink it?

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.100
It's too bitter.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:36.840
You silly child.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.900
How can the fever go down

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.220
if you don't take the medicine?

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.340
Why scold her?

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.820
Those words

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.020
are unlucky.

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.940
I...

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.540
Let me feed her, okay?

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.900
Come on, you do it.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.440
Let's see
if you can make her drink it.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.580
Show us how it's done.

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.070
- Dad.
- Good girl.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:53.940
Do me a favor.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.100
Just take a sip.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.700
Come on, just one sip.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.900
Good medicine tastes bitter.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:01.860
Take a sip.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.180
Just take a sip.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.340
Take a sip.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.360
- Gongcai.
- One sip.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.220
Dad.

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.620
Good-for-nothing.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.620
Let Mr. Lin feed her.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.820
He's the Vice Prefect

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:14.900
and our ancestor.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.340
She'll surely drink it.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.820
Mr. Lin.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.020
Please help.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.460
Your status is different.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.220
You're our ancestor...

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.460
No.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.460
You're the Vice Prefect.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.340
She'd surely listen to you.

00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.580
No matter what,

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.020
make her drink the medicine.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.300
Please help.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.860
Please.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.500
Please help us.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.500
Thanks, thanks.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.020
Drink the medicine.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.060
Here.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:03.940
Drink the medicine.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.940
Look.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.300
So soon.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.740
I want to sleep now.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.700
You should leave.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.420
She finished so soon?

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.580
Alright, Jicai wants to sleep. Let's go.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.500
Yangyang, let's go.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.540
Let's go.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.460
- Let's go.
- Jicai, sleep well.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.660
I'll take it. Let's go.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.700
Sleep well, Jicai.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.460
If you feel unwell,

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:41.780
just call out.
