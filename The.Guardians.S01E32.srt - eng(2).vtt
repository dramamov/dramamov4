[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 32]

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.660
Gu Yangshan has been sidelined
at the Sino-US Special Research Institute

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.460
in Chongqing all these years.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.100
After coming back to Shanghai,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.540
he never got involved

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.100
in the real cleanup of seized assets.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.380
Even the Gu family can barely
hold on now.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.100
And Meng Mingyi is a notorious traitor.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.100
I doubt the Gu family can do
anything about this.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.100
Let's wait for news
from the organization.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.060
We can't wait any longer.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.660
The execution will be carried out
tomorrow noon.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.410
And Miss Meng is on the execution list

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.540
of this batch.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.690
Right now, apart from Gu Yangshan,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.540
none of us have any way at all

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.130
to pull Miss Meng out of their grasp

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.100
within just a single day.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.100
Miss Meng saved my life
several times back then.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.820
I can't just watch her
walk to her death.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.100
But back then, Gu Yangshan left
in such disgrace.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.660
Are you sure he'll see you?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.780
I trust him.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.980
Auntie Wang, how is it?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.540
Young Master, Inspector Liu just called.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.140
He said he went to the Meng's residence.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.130
But there was no one there.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.100
He's heading
to the Elimination Committee

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.660
to see if Miss Meng has been arrested.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.100
Alright.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.260
Let me know if there's any news.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.780
One more thing.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.820
There's a man outside in sunglasses
asking for you.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.570
He said his surname is Ding.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.370
After hearing that the Master is ill,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.020
he asked me to give this to you

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.340
and then left.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.250
Alright.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.460
I see, Auntie Wang.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.220
You go ahead.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.120
[Metropol Hotel]

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.580
Where's Chief Cao?

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.700
He just left.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.700
How's Commander Gu's health?

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.700
Pretty good.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.050
Director Dai and Deputy Director Mao

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.020
are very concerned about Commander Gu.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.450
They said they would pay him a visit.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.270
But they're worried it might
disturb him.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.140
So they told me

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.660
to call them as soon as I see you.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.730
No, no, no.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.460
No need to trouble them.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.490
I actually want to ask you

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.980
[Meng Jie]
about this list.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.610
They're traitors to the nation

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.050
and should be dealt with.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.190
Is there a problem with that?

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.580
No problem at all.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.700
If they really are traitors,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.220
then they do deserve to be executed.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.370
But Meng Jie was a hero
of the Sword Thrust Operation.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.460
Why would her name be on that list?

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.020
Gu Yangshan,

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.810
have you forgotten?

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.960
The higher-ups made their decision
long ago.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.810
The Sword Thrust Operation

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.200
was a complete failure.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.580
In a failed mission,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.020
there can be no heroes.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.340
You're the only son of Commander Gu,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.580
and for years you've always led
from the front.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.720
But why are you still
just a lieutenant colonel?

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.900
Isn't it because
while stationed in Shanghai,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.990
you were suspected
of colluding with the communists?

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.700
Now that Commander Gu has retired,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.020
you must be careful
not to make a wrong move

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.900
and get yourself linked
with traitors again.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.700
Besides, her father's already fallen
from power.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.460
Then she's of no use to you anymore.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.140
Why would you even

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.580
risk your future for her?

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.810
One must have value

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.220
in order to keep living.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.140
Of course.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.580
Why do you think back then

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.460
everyone turned their back on me,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.460
but treated Liang Jingyuan with care?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.140
Where did this come from?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.140
Looks like it's from the Tang Yue Kiln.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.020
A newly acquired piece?

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.580
You never take my advice, do you?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.700
Things like these antiques
and paintings,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.960
you should be asking Chief Cao.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.410
You know me,

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.580
I've never had any interest
in such things.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.140
Long time no see.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.460
It's been a while.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.220
The first time I met you
was five years ago.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.700
It was in this very room.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.640
The moment I walked in,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.580
you hit me with a shot right away.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.050
Yeah.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.930
But over these five years,

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.290
you've changed a lot.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.140
But you haven't changed at all
in these five years.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.580
Really?

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.240
[Wedding Invitation]

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.220
This is for you.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.640
It's happening in a few days.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.490
The position of best man

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.360
[Ding Yi & Xian Biyun]

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.220
is reserved for you.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.300
Come or not?

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.180
Looks like you finally get
what you want.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.850
Congrats.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.490
But before the wedding,

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.850
we have to get Miss Meng out first.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.700
To rescue Miss Meng

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.200
was from your Party Committee, right?

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.610
Not really.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.010
It was my wife's idea.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.980
She said Miss Meng is our benefactor.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.610
So she has to be there
on our wedding day.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.730
Alright, enough.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.820
Stop trying to fool me.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.490
Your people have been in touch
with me for years.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.010
I can tell right away if you're acting.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.580
Besides, the execution list

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.060
is never made public.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.490
So without someone

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.730
tipping you off,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.220
how could you know so quickly?

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.730
Next, you must not ask me

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.340
who provided me with the information.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.500
Even if you cover my head

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.660
and drag me to Maxin Theatre,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.460
plus throw in ten gold bars,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.340
I still won't say a single word.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.700
Alright.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.340
But no matter who it is,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.820
thank him for me.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.420
Actually, I know the reason why you went

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.820
to the Gu Residence to find me.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.460
But the Gu family now

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.670
is nothing like it used to be.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.340
I just went to Shanghai Bureau

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.980
and got turned down cold.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.300
So getting Miss Meng out

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.980
isn't as easy as I thought.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.820
But you already have a plan, right?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.100
Yeah, but I'll need your help.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.580
Of course.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.100
Today, in Chief Cao's office,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.490
I saw a celadon vase
from the Tang Yue Kiln.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.980
It's worth a fortune.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:59.980
And years ago,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.100
I saw that very vase
at the Meng's.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.100
Now it suddenly turns up
at Shanghai Bureau.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.060
It must be that Chief Cao

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.980
took advantage of clearing seized assets

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.440
to fill his own pockets

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.720
and embezzle for personal gain.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.300
If there's one piece,
there'll be a second and third.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.220
Chief Cao.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.700
The warehouse security
of the Seized Asset Disposal Committee

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.700
is handled
by the Shanghai Garrison Command.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.980
Liu Changdong,
the acting Deputy Commander,

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.440
served under my father back in the day.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.060
I'll have him get the evidence.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.220
Then it's your move after that.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.580
What do you need us to do?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.300
Make it public.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.700
I know your Party's publications

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.060
have strong influence in Shanghai.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.940
It is now a critical moment

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.850
for negotiations
between the two parties.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.100
The Chairman wants to make an example
of someone,

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.430
so once he finds out the evidence
of the Seized Asset Disposal Committee

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.210
colluding with the Elimination Committee
in embezzlement.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.720
If it stirs up enough public pressure,

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.580
we might be able to halt the execution,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.220
and push for a retrial.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.460
Do you even realize what you're saying?

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.580
I do.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.220
We've got 12 hours left.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.220
Inspector Liu should be on the way
to deliver the photos.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.100
Once you get the photos,

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.220
I'll need you to hand them
to your superiors,

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.850
and ask them to send them
to the newspaper.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.460
So by six in the morning,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.340
I expect these photos will

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.580
spread across every corner of Shanghai.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.700
If all goes well,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.580
I guess, by around ten,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.890
someone from Shanghai will

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.220
call the Chairman's Huangshan Residence.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.180
I've seen the way

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.220
your Party works.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.580
I'm sure you can do this.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.740
If they find it out,

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.440
they'll call it betraying the party
and the nation.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.620
But it was clearly they
who first betrayed

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.220
the Three Principles of the People.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.220
I misread you just now.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.860
You've changed over these five years,

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.620
and changed a lot.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.690
My father is determined to leave.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.720
I have nothing left to hold me back.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.500
At last, I can walk the same path
as you.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.260
I've been on the wrong path
all this time.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.260
If I still don't turn back,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.860
I shall die alone

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.020
in the desert of life.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:22.860
No...

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.860
No one would even shed a tear for me.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.620
Father!

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.620
Father!

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.140
Father!

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.020
My sweety...

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.260
Father!

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.740
Does calling him help now?

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.860
Back when you worked for the Japanese,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.260
so many of our fellow countrymen

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.500
were separated from their families,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.220
did you ever hold back?

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.120
Did you ever feel sympathy?

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.500
I never harmed a single Chinese.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.740
I even helped in resisting Japan.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.980
I helped!

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.500
If you don't believe me, ask Shixian.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.860
Go find Shixian.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.380
He can vouch for me.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.260
I'm not lying to you.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.380
You helped?

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.020
I really did help.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.770
I bled and sacrificed on the frontline,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.260
while you and Shixian

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.690
were enjoying love in the large mansion
in Sanyangli.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.980
If that's what you call resisting Japan,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.080
then what does that make me?

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.860
No, no, that's not it!

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.500
You've got it all wrong!

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.380
I really helped them.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.770
I helped a man named Joseph Lee.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.260
I...I covered for him.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.860
He has a wife named Xian Biyun.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.620
They're both fighters resisting Japan.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.650
I'm not lying to you.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.500
I swear, I'm not lying to you.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.140
Please...

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.260
Joseph Lee and Xian Biyun
are communists.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.380
If that's really true,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.140
you not only betray the country
but also collude with the enemy.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.140
I'm not.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.860
Sweety...Sweety, stop talking.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.460
It's my fault.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.500
I drag you into this.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.090
Father...

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:25.180
Father!

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.500
Father!

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.180
Father!

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.180
Father!

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.700
Father!

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.810
Stop!

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.700
Father!

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.220
Father!

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.940
Father!

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.500
Father!

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.990
What are you doing, Gu Yangshan?

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.740
Father!

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.020
Father!

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.740
Father!

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.700
Father!

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.570
You killed her father
right in front of her.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.790
Do you still have any conscience?

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.180
They're traitors, worse than animals.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.390
Do you even need a special spot
to slaughter them?

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.740
Start!

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.370
Bro,

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:43.460
don't move, step back.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.180
Don't move.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.740
Gu Yangshan, are you trying
to block the execution?

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.020
Let me tell you,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.740
I'm taking Meng Jie with me today.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.420
Then go ahead.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.940
Come on, fire.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.660
You try too.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.810
Deputy Chief Luo,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.660
I just received a special order
from the Chairman,

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.810
saying holding an open trial
for these traitors

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.420
to prevent any wrongful convictions.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:16.940
Stop the execution immediately.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.020
It's fine now.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.700
Bear with it for a few days.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.500
I'll help prepare your defense
for the trial.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.020
Get in the car.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.020
You are a liar.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.500
Liar!

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.020
Meng Jie.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:24.740
Meng Jie.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.770
Liar!

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:30.810
Meng Jie.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.260
Let me go.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.260
Meng Jie.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.420
Let me go.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.050
Luo, take a look at this.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.500
Just a couple of days ago,

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.660
we confiscated the Meng family's assets.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.980
Now these red publications

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.220
are accusing us
of lining our own pockets.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.890
[New Five Scholars Picture,
the Elimination Committee]

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.020
They even slam the Elimination Committee

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.500
labels loyal people as traitors,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.460
just to seize their property.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.420
Isn't that absurd?

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.050
I'll shut down that newspaper.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.700
What's the point of shutting it down?

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.740
They already have solid evidence.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.940
Take a good look at that photo.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.050
We just want to show off,

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.980
but we end up embarrassing ourselves.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.180
Isn't this humiliating?

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.020
How on earth did they

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.460
get the photos of the warehouse?

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.940
Deputy Chief Luo,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.940
right now in Shanghai,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.810
from when the mayor of Shanghai

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.740
takes office,

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.320
down to whose hen lays an egg

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.780
to make a scrambled eggs with chives.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.700
Don't the communists know all about it?

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.940
I really don't understand

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.700
how you get into trouble with them.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.420
Report.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.260
Come in.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.530
Chief Cao, Deputy Chief Luo,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.530
the people we sent to tail Meng Jie

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.020
actually got photos. Please take a look.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.700
But they're really on high alert.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.330
Our people lost track of them.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.500
So it really is him.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:45.530
I see.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.460
Yes, sir.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.260
My guess was right.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.500
It's not just the Communist Party
involved in this.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.500
There's also an insider.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.020
How is she?

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.530
She just fell asleep
after taking sedatives.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.740
The best psychiatrists
at Puci Sanatorium

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.260
are currently at the Chaosheng Troupe.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.180
I bring them over now.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.020
You just showed your face on the street.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.980
Luo Han definitely won't let this go.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.260
And I suspect

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.980
the Chaosheng Troupe
may not be safe anymore.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.500
How about this?

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.020
You bring Ms. Xian and these doctors

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.530
to my place.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.500
At least for now, no one dares
to search the Gu Residence.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.640
No, I can't. The identities

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.260
of these doctors are very sensitive now.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.810
We can't let you get into more trouble.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.980
Back when you helped me before,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.180
were you afraid of trouble?

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.020
That was different.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.700
Back then, we were

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.260
like people with nothing to lose.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.500
But now, you…

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.940
This is your home.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.020
We can't put your family at risk.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.700
Yes, it's different.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.460
But now we

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.260
are already walking the same path.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.180
Tomorrow, I'll send my father

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.420
to London for treatment.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.180
By then,

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.050
I won't have

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.420
any more worries holding me back.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.660
Alright, we'll go with my plan.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.660
Tonight I will have Inspector Liu

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.370
cover your departure from Shanghai.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:43.130
Alright.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.050
We'll do it your way then.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.260
Once I get Biyun and these doctors

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.530
safely out of Shanghai,

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:58.280
I'll rush back right away.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.020
Why would you come back?

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.690

This is my mission.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.570

safely out of Shanghai.

But a few people are still missing.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.330
So I can't leave yet.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.330
But Ding Yi, you have to understand,

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.180
you are in a more dangerous situation.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.280
Luo Han is completely
out of control now.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.290
If he finds you,

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.020
he won't need to wait at all
if he wants to kill you.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.900
That's exactly why I need your help.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.530
Cover for me when necessary.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:57.810
Do you have to do this?

00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:59.420
Yes, I do.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.290
You're still as stubborn as ever.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.590
You haven't changed in five years.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.900
Back then you kept it from me
to help Ms. Xian.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.900
Now you're hiding it from her,
so I can help you.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.420
Does Ms. Xian know?

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.330
I can't let her know.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.290
Seriously, don't tell her.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.460
Otherwise she'll cling on and insist

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.550
on rushing back with me.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:28.570
So annoying!

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.180
I do wonder,

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.360
once Ms. Xian finds out your plan,

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.690
how she's going to deal with you.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.850
Oh right,

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.060
do you still remember

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.590
when the three of us were in Sanyangli,

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.900
and on my birthday

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.420
we took a group photo?

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.420
Yeah.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.180
On such a joyful day,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.660
let's take a photo for memories.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.330
Yeah. Ms. Xian, step a bit more
to the center.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.570
It's fine, just leave a little space
for me.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.500
I'm slim.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.430
The KMT-Communist Party
tensions flared up again.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.740
On September 30,

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.500
Han Deqin's unit issued
an eradication order,

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.290
vowing to deploy all its elite forces...

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.180
But unfortunately,

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.180
that photo did not capture

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.980
your and Biyun's faces.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.980
But I think today's a great chance.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.900
How about we retake that photo

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.530
till Biyun comes later?

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:01.420
Then I'd better
switch off the radio beforehand.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.420
Clear away the coal ash.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.250
Make sure no one can tell
someone lived here.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.260
Once it's done, we head out right away.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.810

Father.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.660
London rains quite often.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.980
I've packed more clothes for you.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.180
The doctor's already been arranged.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.530
I've told Auntie Wang everything.
Don't worry.

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.420
You really don't want to leave

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.660
and go with me?

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.420
I still have unfinished business.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.180
Once it's done, I'll rush to London.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.160

[Shatian Registration Certificate]
These are some of our properties.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.290
They were taken over during the War
of Resistance against Japan.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.320
Now they've been returned.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.740
You're living comfortably on your own.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.420
You don't need them.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.690
I want to donate it all
to the Government.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.940
Tomorrow, invite Chief Cao

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.500
to come over for some tea at our home.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:20.500
Father,

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.770
is all this because I rescued Miss Meng?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.260
Liang Hongzhi's villa went
to Bai Chongxi.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.740
Chen Gongbo's villa went to Dean Song.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.220
And Luo Hongyi's estate
was taken by Gu Zhutong.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.060
Even the courtyard

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.060
of Shanghai BIS

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.060
was the original property
of Wang.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.220
If you still want to live
on someone else's land,

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.220
you have to play by their rules.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.980
Father, since I was a child,
you've told me

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.800
that my grandfather and great-uncles

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.670
fell during the Great Revolution,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.020
for the dream of a Republic for China.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.980
And my uncles and elders

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.770
fell on the road
of the Northern Expedition,

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.610
to fight for a unified China.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:23.850
And Bingqing.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.490
She fell at the forefront of the march
resisting the Japanese.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.700
The Gu family has shed blood
for this land for generations.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.610
We didn't come here
to uphold rules like these.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.700
So what exactly are you planning to do?

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.090
Father,

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.940
I think it's time for someone to step up

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.260
and establish a new set of rules.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.370
Seems that over the years in Shanghai,

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.460
you've truly made some good friends.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.700
The Three Principles of the People
is the path I hope you'd follow.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.060
But now it seems

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.610
you have a path of your own in mind.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.060
Father, the good friend you mentioned
has arrived.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.020
They're all on high alert.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.060
After getting off the car,

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.570
they managed to shake off our lookout.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.700
But looking at the map,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.570
the two stations where they got off

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:55.060
are close to each other.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.740
I've stationed people all around.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.570
They'll definitely show up again.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.220
Th...this is…

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.130
The Gu Residence on Nanyang Road.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.940
Pull your people back.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.060
Come with me to search the Gu Residence.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.020
The Gu Residence?

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:33.980
Yes.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.500
Inform Deputy Director Mao.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.460
Tell him I've obtained new evidence.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.330
These communists are hiding
inside the Gu Residence.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.980
Ask him to issue a search warrant.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.020
But…

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.740
No buts.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.940
The success depends on this.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.500
If we can't find them,

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.700
I will take full responsibility.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.500
No matter what,

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.330
I can't let Ding Yi and Gu Yangshan
get away.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.820
Alright, it's decided then.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:28.940
Ms. Xian.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.210
Can we talk in private?

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.460
Everything's been arranged.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.900
Tonight, Inspector Liu

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.170
will bring the transport vehicle
from the Police Bureau.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:59.480
After your negotiations are done,

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.880
you can drive it
out of the city.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:02.090
No one will stop you.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.500
Thanks.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.900
Don't mention it.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.940
I should be thanking you.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:12.060
Dr. Lin just finished
examining Meng Jie.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.900
He said she's suffered
a huge emotional shock,

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.290
which triggered a mental breakdown.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.170
It's initially diagnosed

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.170
as schizophrenia.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.170
But it needs further confirmation.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.570
By the way, I haven't asked you yet.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.820
How's Commander Gu's health?

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.550
Liver cancer.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:44.540
The people around him told me

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.820
that my father had shown signs long ago,

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.650
but he kept enduring it
without seeing a doctor.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.170
Sorry for that.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.130
He devotes his whole life
to the revolution,

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.610
yet in the end,

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:02.570
he has to live far away overseas.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.900
What about you?

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.420
Do you have any plans?

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.090
Ding Yi has missed you all these years.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.790
He knows you've been
studying the Joseph Cipher

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.200
since you returned to Chongqing.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.540
He said,

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.540
you must be unwilling to give up.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.860
Ms. Xian,

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.290
I know what you're trying to tell me.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.210
Honestly, I've envied Ding Yi
all these years,

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.210
because he was lucky enough to meet you,

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.060
and you led him

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.090
onto the right path.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.060
I believe if I were in his shoes
back then,

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:47.420
I would've made the exact same choice.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.170
But sadly...

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.090
I fixed that old camera.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:58.730
Come on.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.210
Let's go.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.420
I think...

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:08.820
Sit here.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.250
It's gotta be exactly like before.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.540
Mainly, I have to hold both of you down

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:18.650
and see

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:20.130
which one of you can still run away.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.650
Alright, ready.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:27.940
You three, look over here.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.540
Give me a smile.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:32.610
One.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.860
Two.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.730
Three.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.060
This…

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.500
What a lousy camera!

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.020
I've been fixing it for a long time.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.460
I thought it was fixed.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.820
Why is it...?

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:48.610
Wait, wait.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:49.650
How do I handle this?

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.210
I'm telling you, this camera I have now

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.210
is mainly for collection,

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.250
not for taking photos.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:55.130
Don't break it.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.020
Young Master.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.820
Auntie Wang.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.650
Young Master!

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:58.290
What's going on?

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.340
Something happened.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.540
Deputy Chief Luo and his people
are here,

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.260
saying they want
to search the Gu Residence.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.380
What for?

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.170
Don't move.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.500
Who are you?

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.170
Stay there!

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.570
Auntie Wang,

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.340
please take our guests inside.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.090
I'll handle this.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.170
Be careful.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.130
I'll go with you.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.420
You get inside too.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.570
This is my home.
I can't let them walk in.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.540
Biyun,

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.650
take them in first.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:43.340
I'll go...

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.420
Since you're already here,

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:46.540
you're my guests.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.880
No matter how bad things gets,

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:52.170
we never turn guests away.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.500
Let my son handle whatever's outside.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.130
Please, follow me.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.170
Luo Han,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.170
why do you bring so many people here?

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.860
Sorry for disturbing you.
It's an official duty.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.250
What official duty?

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.460
I suspect you're hiding traitors.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.940
Deputy Director Mao has already
obtained permission

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.730
from Chairman Chiang

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.440
and ordered me to search
all Gu family's properties,

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.750
including the Gu Residence.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.980
You're saying our family
harbors traitors.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.250
You even got Chairman Chiang's
permission

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:46.460
to search our home.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.250
Permission, huh?

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.540
Where's the search warrant?

00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:58.860
Luo Han,

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.340
I know you're the Deputy Chief now.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.340
It's normal for you
to have official duties.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.440
I can allow you to search our home,

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.500
but only you go in alone.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.980
If they all want to go in,

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.200
then you'd better think
about the consequences.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.650
I decide what the consequences are.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.170
Fine.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:21.250
Go.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:22.350
Yes, sir.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.090
How dare you, Gu Yangshan!

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.090
Sorry, my aim was off.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.340
I should kill you.

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.500
Come on, who else wants to try?

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.840
The moment you fired this shot,

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.860
you became a traitor to the Party-State.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.980
There's no reason
we can't search a traitor's house.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.060
Take out your guns.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.570
Listen, if anyone dares to hit you,

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:56.340
you hit them right back!

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.060
Yes, sir.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.570
It's just a scratch. Get up yourself.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.500
Try it.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.860
Young Master, Young Master!

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.060
Master asks you
to invite Deputy Chief Luo inside.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.340
Master, Master.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.060
Commander Gu, sorry to trouble you.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.650
Yangshan,

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:56.420
since Deputy Chief Luo
is on official duty,

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.060
then let him search.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.650
The Gu family has nothing to hide.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.170
There's nothing shameful here.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.060
We welcome the Party-State's inspection!

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:09.340
Yes.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.080
Please pardon the intrusion.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.170
Search.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.340
Yes, sir!

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:23.900
Seal every written document

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.210
and take them back for review!

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.980
Yes, sir!

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.290
Yangshan,

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.900
we're just in the way here.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:41.860
Come walk with me in the yard.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.060
Alright.
