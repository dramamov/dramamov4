00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.840
The Censorate impeaches the Vice Prefect

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.480
for turning a blind eye to those
who set up temple music

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.970
on the streets at night.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.860
Is this true?

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.650
Your Majesty,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.050
I did consult with the Jinwu Guards

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.960
to occasionally allow
some flexibility for night travelers.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.620
Your Majesty,

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.660
Mr. Lin did more than that.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.910
After nightfall,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.940
merchants are still
doing their business.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.180
What should the Prefecture do?

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.060
Travel is prohibited
after the evening drum

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.600
and allowed after the morning bell.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.380
But for example,
on the Mid-Autumn Festival,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.200
the Market Director
needs to admire the moon.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.840
No one beats the evening drum,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.480
and the commoners don't know
that the night curfew has started.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.060
Should we blame them?

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.300
Lin Anran,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.740
during the festival,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.820
it was you

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.900
who let the market officials
go home early,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.700
causing the evening drum
not to be beaten.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.740
At the festival,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.940
isn't it right to let people

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.260
go home and reunite?

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.300
You are leading the violation
of the night curfew

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.500
and condoning bandits.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.620
What are your intentions?

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.500
It's strange that since I took office,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.260
not a single thief has been caught,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.060
but ordinary people
who violate the curfew

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.740
are increasing day by day.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.900
Mr. Lin,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.020
what do you mean by this?

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.540
Isn't this your dereliction of duty?

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.980
Vice Prefect,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.140
why do the commoners
repeatedly violate the night curfew?

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.100
Under your rule,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.380
the world is peaceful and clear,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.640
and bandits are becoming fewer.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.920
Take Juxian Alley as an example.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.540
If the diners

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.500
are not careful,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.540
merchants and customers

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.380
will travel home at night.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.660
Over time,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.380
the ghost market will naturally emerge.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.340
If we prohibit it,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.220
the people will inevitably complain.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.580
But if we loosen up a bit

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.020
and nothing goes wrong,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.100
it'll be more beneficial
to the people's livelihood.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.500
This is the first time I've heard

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.580
of the ghost market.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.780
It's a market set up at night, right?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.860
Has the Ministry of Revenue
investigated it?

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.210
Your Majesty,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.070
I...

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.660
Your Majesty,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.340
these are the results of the discussions

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.140
between the Revenue and the Prefecture.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.540
It's better to guide than to block.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.980
Slightly relaxing the night curfew

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.740
will be more beneficial to market taxes.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.860
Yes, yes.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.740
Your Majesty,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.980
secretly relaxing the curfew...

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.940
I know the Rites values
the ancestral system.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.220
However, the world
is not governed in one way;

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.740
the state is not bound by ancient laws.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.380
Relaxing a bit

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.180
is allowable.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.220
The fever has subsided.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.020
The punishment from the heavens

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.420
has finally ended.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.140
Just forget all those things.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.300
You often say things

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.820
that others don't understand.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.780
It's nothing serious.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.020
However,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.420
in some word choices,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.860
you should

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.780
be more cautious.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.540
Drink the medicine.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.540
If you feel unwell,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.900
just call out.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.340
(The ancestor claims
he doesn't remember,)

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.220
(but recently,)

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.940
(why has he become so gentle?)

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.380
You look like a demon.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.540
Looking like this,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.840
you must've scared the ancestor.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.220
(Xuanzheng Gate)

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.860
Don't blame me for not covering for you.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.380
In the Censorate,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.660
I'm nothing.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.540
No one told me
we were going to impeach you.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.100
I was really worried

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.780
that you'd be punished,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.980
but I didn't expect

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.500
that you'd remain calm

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.740
and even tease them.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.860
Wait a minute.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.140
Did you anticipate this?

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.100
So,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.820
you're going with the flow.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.740
Good for you.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.020
If only I could be

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.380
as clever as you.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.340
Alright.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.580
Goodbye.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.740
Mr. Lin,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.700
please wait.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.300
Mr. Cao.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.940
Thank you

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.300
for your mooncake.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.260
Could you come to my home for a chat?

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.300
Please.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.460
(Cao Mansion)

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.420
(Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.
May you sail far)

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.820
(and come home to true friends
with aspirations unchanged.)

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.340
May you sail far

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.260
and come home

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.100
to true friends

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.900
with aspirations unchanged.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.340
Mr. Lin,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.180
when I came

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.340
to Yong'an to take office,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.260
I stayed at a close friend's house.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.420
He wrote the Ode to Friends for me,

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.610
(Happy Mid-Autumn Festival)
which includes these lines.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.220
I didn't expect

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.540
to see them again

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.540
in the handwriting attached

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.460
to the mooncake from you.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.580
Your running script is

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.540
also similar to the handwriting
of my friend.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.660
The running script
is connected in meaning,

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.460
so it's common

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.660
to be similar.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.740
Yunlai Tavern's case could've been

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.460
handed over to the Judicial Review

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.980
since we have to recuse ourselves

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.740
due to the Shen family.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.100
Why give it to the Justice?

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.580
Cao Rong from the Justice

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.140
is still just a Vice Minister

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.300
because

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.260
he is too upright and impartial,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.460
making too many enemies.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.080
There must be connections

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.780
in court behind Yunlai.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.460
Let's use this case to test

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.900
whether Cao Rong

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.300
is truly upright

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.620
or just pretending.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.860
Didn't Cao Rong use

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.220
to be friends with your father?

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.500
Do you want to deal with him?

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.860
When your family got into trouble,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.300
he didn't say a word.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.460
Is it dangerous

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.540
to approach him rashly?

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.420
I didn't find anyone

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.340
speaking up for my family back then.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.220
But I managed to look

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.700
at the documents from the Personnel.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.460
After the Cui case,

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.260
Cao Rong was demoted for five years

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.620
without a clear reason.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.820
I guess

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.940
he might have been punished

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.340
for speaking up

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.020
for Father.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.500
Pardon my rudeness.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.260
Your appearance

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.340
resembles

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.820
the wife of my old friend.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.740
My old friend

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.660
was Cui Rangzhi from Qingyang.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.580
His wife came

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.860
from the Lu family in Xiuzhou.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.940
Have you ever known them?

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.940
The Cui family from Qingyang?

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.340
They were criminals

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.100
selling official positions 17 years ago.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.660
And you were once their friend?

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.540
17 years ago,

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.780
you were just a young student.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.380
How could you know about that case?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.020
Cui was the Prefect back then,

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.100
but his crimes were obvious

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.340
and shocking.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.580
Now, I am the Vice Prefect.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.620
It's only natural for me to know

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.540
an old case with solid evidence.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.100
What nonsense.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.420
Rangzhi would never do such a thing.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.340
Before the Judicial Review

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.180
could review the case,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.300
Rangzhi died miserably in prison.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.220
He must be innocent.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.780
If that's true,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.020
why didn't you speak up

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.940
for the Cui family back then?

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.620
You've just touched upon my sore spot.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.980
Back then,

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.500
I was just a clerk in the Chancellery.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.500
No one listened to me.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.380
I kept petitioning

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.060
and was eventually demoted to Lingnan,

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.380
ending up with a broken family.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.700
Living alone,

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.540
I now have nothing to lose.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.300
Seven years.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.780
It took me seven years

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.460
to return to the Capital.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.660
I did everything I could
to get into the Justice,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.980
and now I've reached this position.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.900
I want to wait for the right moment.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.100
One day,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.980
I will clear the names

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.860
of Rangzhi's family.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.180
It seems that you were indeed

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.120
a close friend of Cui Ning.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.420
If there was new evidence

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.340
that could clear Cui Ning's name,

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.300
but it'd risk your life and fortune,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.780
what would you do?

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.220
My life and fortune

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.180
are long gone.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.100
Why ask me that?

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.540
You must be related to the Cui family.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.780
Do you have any new evidence?

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.060
What would you do?

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.460
Hurry.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.340
Let's go see His Majesty.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.300
Mr. Cao,

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.980
calm down.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.300
You just need to go with me

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.620
to clarify things before His Majesty.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.860
Whatever happens,

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.260
I will take full responsibility.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.540
I am no longer the clerk I used to be.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.340
If I demonstrated my resolve
by hitting a pillar,

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.500
His Majesty

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.420
would not ignore this.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.380
Mr. Cao,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.020
calm down.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.260
Why should I?

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.580
It's been 17 years.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.780
My head should have shattered

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.620
for the Cui family long ago.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.660
Mr. Cao, you mustn't.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.860
Mr. Cao.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.500
I have nothing to lose.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.460
I...

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.940
Why hold me?

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.060
Mr. Cao.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.540
Milord.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.860
- Pastries are ready...
- Let go.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.420
I'm Cui Che.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.060
Greetings, Uncle.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:05.790
Che.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.860
Are you really Che?

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.580
I never expected

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.500
that in my lifetime,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.700
I'd see Rangzhi's son again.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.980
Sit.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.140
Sit down.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.100
Sorry

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.580
for all the tests just now.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.380
It's alright.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.700
It's good

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.860
that you're cautious.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.460
Child,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.940
you must've suffered a lot.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.540
How did you survive?

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.660
When I was young,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.660
Prince Zhao saved me.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.620
Prince Zhao?

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.220
Why would he help you?

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.260
Prince Zhao used to correspond
with my father,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.500
regarding him as a confidant.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.900
When that case broke out,

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.380
he sent people to look for me.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.580
At that time, his eldest son, Li Sheng,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.780
was about to be made the heir,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.060
but he died of illness.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:02.980
And I

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.780
bore a resemblance to Li Sheng

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.660
and could comfort Prince Zhao.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.100
So, he adopted me.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.220
Luckily, it was Prince Zhao.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.260
If it had been me back then,

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.930
even if I had saved you,

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.980
I couldn't have given you

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.900
an identity to move around freely.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.180
Uncle, don't say that.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.420
After that case,

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.260
your house in the Capital was sealed

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.100
and later demolished.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.020
I even went to Qingyang,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.380
but your house there

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.130
was also razed to the ground.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.820
I really thought you were...

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.540
Good.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.260
You've grown up.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.730
I didn't intend to disturb you,

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.820
but now,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.500
I don't have any evidence.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.160
I really need your guidance

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.130
for the road ahead.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.620
Child,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.540
I only learned the details

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.580
after I returned to the Capital.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.930
This case involved

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.400
the Ministry of War
and the Sixteen Guards.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.860
It seemed to shake the foundation,

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.500
so it was dealt with severely.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.380
The evidence
in the hands of the official

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.740
who reported the case

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.460
directly pointed to your father,

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.420
and it couldn't be overturned.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.820
I've seen all this

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.460
in the case files.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.780
He claimed that he tried to buy

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.520
an official position from my father,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.800
but failed and was even ambushed.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.100
He had to protect himself.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.140
The evidence he had
was extremely detailed.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.100
My father was immediately stripped
of his position and imprisoned.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.500
Later,

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.080
he committed suicide in prison.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:42.580
Everyone outside said

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.060
that he died of fear of punishment.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.940
The official also died from drowning.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.220
Even Fifth Master Xiao,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.380
who was in charge of the case,

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.860
fell off his horse and fell into a coma,

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.540
lying in bed for years.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.140
Fifth Master Xiao?

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.220
Princess Fuhui's husband?

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.340
Yes.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.780
The case file erased

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.580
the names of all the case handlers.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.980
I had to inquire around

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.420
to finally confirm it was him.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.260
(Yunshui Manor)

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.500
Young Master.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.620
Young Master,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.860
a secret letter from Prince Zhao.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.130
(You've been close to Princess Fuhui.)

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.570
(Get more info about the candidates)

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:30.700
(of the Ministry of War.)

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.580
He wants me

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.100
to find out from Princess Fuhui

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.300
who the candidates are
in the Ministry of War.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.660
When you wanted to come to the Capital,

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.020
he was very anxious

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.300
because he couldn't find anyone

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.260
to help you.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.460
How come he's already

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.540
made acquaintances in the Capital now

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.780
and found out about the Ministry of War?

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.980
Mr. Cao said

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.420
that the person
in charge of the old case

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.700
was the Princess's husband.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.180
Fifth Master Xiao,

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.860
who has been in a coma for years?

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.820
Yes.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.820
Since he could find out,

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.300
it's not a secret.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.860
Given His Highness's age,

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.380
he must've witnessed that case.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.780
He should know about this.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.940
Though he doesn't know
I want to overturn the case,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.020
why has he never

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.180
mentioned Fifth Master Xiao?

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.660
I think...

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.180
I think...

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.740
I can't think of a reason.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.340
I'm not asking you.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.220
By the way,

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.100
the Princess appreciates
the Shen siblings.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.060
Ask them

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.900
to make some dishes later.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.300
I'll send them to the Princess

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.620
and ask about her husband.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.140
Has the fever subsided?

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.260
I'm fine now.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.820
I'm as strong as an ox.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.480
What do you need?

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.300
It's a bit embarrassing.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.020
The Prefecture didn't prepare

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.300
any mooncakes for the Princess.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.820
The festival has just passed,

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.940
and I need to visit her.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.460
It's inevitably awkward.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.020
You ordered so many mooncakes

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.780
from our diner.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.700
Why didn't you send some to her?

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.700
You couldn't have forgotten it,
could you?

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.300
No wonder.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.500
The Princess sent so many invitations

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.700
to Yunshui Manor

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.700
for poetry gatherings or flower shows.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.660
So, they were all dates.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.540
The Princess has many close attendants.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.220
If you send mooncakes to her,

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.740
maybe what she really wants is...

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.700
Shen Shaoguang.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.540
Well.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.100
I'll make

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.580
a savory ham mooncake for you.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.300
You can say
that the ham needs time to cure,

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.780
which is why it's late.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.620
The Princess is so unconventional.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.340
She'd definitely prefer

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.180
the rare savory mooncake.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.300
Though the festival is over,

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.170
showing enough respect

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.020
should be fine.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.180
Thanks.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.660
Your talent for turning black into white

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.620
might make you

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.500
a better official than me.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.180
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.860
This is made specifically

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.780
from a good hind leg of a pig.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.500
After shaping,

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.580
it went through repeated salting

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.220
and was air-dried for a month.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.500
After that, it was washed,

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.140
dried, fermented,

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.900
and stacked.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.700
This is the simplified version.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.860
The more elaborate ones

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.420
are cured in the fall of one year

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.140
and are ready by the following summer.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.660
Some people even prefer

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.820
two-year-old

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.740
or three-year-old legs.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.140
Let me try it.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.820
This ham is so delicious.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.020
It's even better than fresh meat.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.500
If this is so good,

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.820
just imagine how delicious

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.700
those two-year-old

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.000
or three-year-old legs would be.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.660
Of course.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.180
The cured ham has a mellow aroma

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.460
after years of fermentation,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.460
which fresh meat can't compare to.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.540
Mellow aroma after years
of fermentation?

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.140
What does that mean?

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.260
Fresh meat

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.060
is like a young man,

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.040
tender

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.980
but too straightforward,

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.220
lacking a bit of soul.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.740
When cooking with fresh meat,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.340
it's easy for the flavors

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.400
of the seasonings or other dishes
to overpower it.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.980
But an aged ham

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.820
is like a mature man,

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.780
experienced

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.100
and settled.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.140
When cooking with it,

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.220
its flavor will dominate

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.620
and cover other dishes,

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.340
without shaking the foundation.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.420
But I think

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.600
the older the ham gets,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.820
the more flavorful it becomes.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.340
But for a man,

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.820
it's not necessarily true.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.500
Of course.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.460
Look at my brother.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.540
He's old enough

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.820
but not settled at all.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.020
Send it to Sushui City.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.900
But I think

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.460
Mr. Lin is different.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.060
He's young,

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.260
but he's experienced,

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.320
steady, and sophisticated.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.220
What's wrong?

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.340
Indeed.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.220
Mr. Lin

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.140
is experienced,

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.380
steady, and sophisticated.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.220
He just can't hold his liquor.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.740
But it's a good thing.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.340
Is it good for an official?

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.740
Just eat.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.420
I'm eating.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.620
So delicious.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.140
They...

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.180
Lady Shen is talking nonsense.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.540
You can surely hold your liquor.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.460
Besides, how would she know?

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.820
I don't care.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.380
But she is right.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.780
You're experienced,

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.220
steady, and sophisticated.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.380
But she just agreed

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.780
to break off the engagement,

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.100
yet now she's praising you.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.180
Has she changed her mind?

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.580
She doesn't like me at all.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.660
That's good.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.300
We can't repeat the same mistake.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.220
But when you say that,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.420
why does it sound

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.340
like you're grinding your teeth?

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.740
Stop overthinking things.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.220
Just send the letter.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.060
Young Master,

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.300
you didn't mention Mr. Cao

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.140
in this reply to Sushui City, did you?

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.100
No.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.300
Prince Zhao is a benefactor,

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.900
but he is also a vassal.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.580
In the past, I thought

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.140
he loved the people,

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.660
but lately,

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.420
I've had some doubts.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.820
Let's use these pieces
of wood and leather

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.180
to make a box.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.300
It can hold mooncakes

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.700
and can be used daily.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.860
The Princess

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.140
has everything good.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.100
We need to be creative.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.220
You're so smart.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.620
I'll follow your advice.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.020
Since you appreciate me so much,

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.540
how about giving me a few gold bricks

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.500
as a reward?

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.020
Then I'll have to write an IOU.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.330
Here's a pen; write it.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.540
I'm just joking.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:21.980
How could I ask you for money

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.620
when I already owe you so much?

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.060
Glad that you remember.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.020
Actually, I have a question

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.140
I want to ask you.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.820
Alright, go ahead.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:31.940
Your family is

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.980
the most harmonious I've ever seen.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.300
Even if there have been conflicts,

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.260
you ultimately care about each other.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.660
I wonder

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.220
if you've ever

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.460
deceived your family.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.940
That's happened so many times.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.820
Yangyang would sneak sweets.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.660
When my grandparents were alive,

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.260
my grandfather would hide some money.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.340
He shared half with me,

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.060
and I helped him deceive my grandmother.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.620
And my brother.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.660
He's deceived our family even more.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.820
He even

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.180
kept his divorce

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.820
from his ex-wife a secret.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.540
But eventually,

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.060
you all found out.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.620
We tried to pretend

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:09.860
we didn't know at first.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.300
We even lied to Yangyang,

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.060
saying her mother
had gone on a long trip.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.260
But one day,

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.900
Yangyang came back and said

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.580
she knew her parents had separated.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.220
I also know something

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.620
that my family doesn't know.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.780
My sister-in-law has a new lover.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.100
That new lover

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.540
has quite a bit of wealth.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.780
So, my brother felt inferior

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.300
and didn't even try to stop her.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.980
He even helped her move

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.020
to be with her new love.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.060
He told me this when he was drunk.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.660
I wouldn't dare tell my parents,

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.180
or he'd get beaten again.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.100
You must have something on your mind,

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.900
which is why you're asking me

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.900
if I've ever deceived my family.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.940
If you want to talk, I'm your tree hole.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.980
If you don't want to talk,

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.040
I'm still your tree hole.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.020
I have

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.380
a trusted elder,

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.940
but I suddenly realized

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.060
that he seems
to be hiding something from me.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.300
And I'm also

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.340
hiding many things from him.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.300
I don't know why that elder

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.740
is doing this.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.260
But I know you're kind.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.140
You wouldn't hurt others.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.660
If you decide to lie,

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.300
it must be for a reason.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.940
Or it's a white lie.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.100
Lies

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.220
can be white?

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.140
You'd only lie

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.420
for a good reason.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.780
You once told me

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.180
we judge actions, not intentions.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.860
You haven't hurt others yet,

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.420
so there's no need to judge yourself.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.300
Almost done.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.260
How is it?

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.940
Lady Shen is so dexterous

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.420
that she even made such a bag.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.620
Mr. Lin,

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.100
take a look at this.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.460
Is it for carrying on the back?

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.740
Does it look good?

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.380
How nice.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.180
What a clever girl.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.620
Lady Shen

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.220
made these mooncakes too, right?

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.180
Yes.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.020
I've heard

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.460
that Shen's Diner makes these.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.100
The filling is pork.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.820
Why isn't it greasy at all?

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.460
It's especially

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.860
savory,

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:28.780
fresh,

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.820
and mellow.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.020
Lady Shen especially cured these

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.380
for you.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.460
I really like Lady Shen.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.740
I don't even know

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.620
what kind of man

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.180
would be worthy of her.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.460
I hope she won't end up

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.300
all alone

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.340
like me.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.500
You're alone?

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.100
I have a question,

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.420
but I'm afraid it might upset you.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.900
Is it about my husband?

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.890
Are you curious about me?

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.300
I have no taboos.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.980
I had no feelings

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.780
for Fifth Master Xiao.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.740
My father told me to marry him,

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.140
so I did.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.340
After the wedding,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.700
we lived

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.100
separate lives.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.540
One day,

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.380
a man who wasn't good at riding

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.300
somehow insisted on riding.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.580
The horse threw him off a cliff,

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.220
and he never woke up again.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.500
I was actually quite relieved.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.100
He wasn't good at riding,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.620
yet he insisted on riding a horse?

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.060
The horse threw him off a cliff?

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.220
Yes.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.380
Everyone outside says

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.700
that I trained that horse

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.500
and made him fall ill.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.460
If you wanted to kill someone,

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.260
you'd prefer to do it openly.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.580
If you wanted to tame a horse,

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.900
it'd only be

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.420
because you wanted to be
the master of that wild horse.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.500
It'd never be
because of some conspiracy.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.540
Even my brother,

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.140
the current Emperor,

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.620
once questioned

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.060
and doubted me.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.420
I didn't expect you

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.140
to understand me in the Capital.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.860
Recently, those visitors with gifts

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.100
are all trying to find out

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.260
about the arrangements
for the Ministry of War next year.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.420
You're quite patient.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.740
You haven't even asked yet.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.860
But

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.340
I like you,

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.940
so I'll tell you.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.740
Thanks for your info.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.820
The former Minister of War

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.420
was chosen by my sixth brother.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.540
The Emperor and I dislike him.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.740
Now,

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.420
he's been sent as an envoy to Tubo.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.580
We won't have to see him
for a long time.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.940
Though it hasn't been declared,

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.020
if you want to prepare a gift,

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.860
the Military Commissioner
and Imperial Attendant's families

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.060
are visiting friends
and relatives in Yong'an.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.620
Your sixth brother...

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.060
Prince Zhao?

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.940
He's always had connections
with the court

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.420
and even recommended officials?

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.940
These are all bestowed by the Princess.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.420
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)
She said

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.940
these fish badges

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.420
will be your entrance permit.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.740
You'll be able to enter and leave

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.300
the Princess's mansion freely.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.540
Thanks for her kindness,

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.580
but I can go back on my own.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.740
Mr. Lin,

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.460
please understand us.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.540
These are the orders of the Princess.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.420
Please get in the carriage.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.940
You're not yet 30, right?

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.220
So young,

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.820
yet already the Vice Prefect.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.300
This is truly a mark of great promise.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.980
You're upright,

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.140
handsome,

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.100
and elegant.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.140
The Princess appreciates
those qualities the most.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.020
The Princess has invited you
several times before,

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.060
showing great favor.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.540
If you're willing,

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.860
you can even become
one of the Three Lords.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.900
(Yunshui Manor)

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:40.620
Mr. Lin.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.220
Mr. Lin,

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.310
please consider

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.860
what I said.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.860
After all,
it's the wish of the Princess.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.460
With the Princess's support

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.660
and your character,

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.020
you'll have a bright future.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.660
You flatter me.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.740
You flatter me.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.660
Mr. Lin, goodbye.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.100
Grandpa, I don't understand

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.700
what they're saying at all.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.860
Let's go.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:06.720
Let's go to the diner.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.040
Something big is going to happen.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.100
- Hurry.
- What's wrong?

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.760
Hurry, hurry up.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.100
(Temporarily Closed)
Handsome, Handsome.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.660
Don't be so quiet inside.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.140
Come out and let us see you.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.320
Handsome, let us see if you're okay,

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.020
(Handsome Shen's Sayings)
and we'll leave.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.940
- Handsome.
- Handsome.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.420
- Handsome.
- Handsome.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.660
Come out and meet us.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.020
Are all the women in ancient times

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.340
so crazy?

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.780
Deyuan,

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.780
hang in there.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.580
What to do?

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.540
Come on.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.340
This is too crazy.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.220
Come on.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.780
After that poetry gathering,

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.380
as the Princess ordered,

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.300
someone collected what I said

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.740
and made it into a collection.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:50.780
And recently,

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.060
many bookshops have started

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.780
using the woodblock printing technology.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.660
It's less time-consuming
than manual copying.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.740
So, its dissemination speed

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.180
just shoots up.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.260
Plus,

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.500
my personal image

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:04.980
is indeed

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.580
quite acceptable,

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.660
isn't it?

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.260
Nowadays, these women

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.620
are really not picky about men.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.860
(Handsome Shen)
But you have to persuade them

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.260
not to block the entrance.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.340
This affects our business.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.220
Mom, what do you mean?

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.220
What's lacking now

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.700
is an understanding of aesthetics.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.020
How tasteful they are.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.020
Don't worry.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.300
I will definitely manage

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.220
my Gongcai Fan.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.740
Gongcai Fan?

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.660
Let me warn you:

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.620
Shen Shaojie,

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.220
the one these women like

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.820
is the fake you,

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.220
not the real you.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.760
You mustn't do

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.140
something inappropriate with them.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.060
Do you hear me?

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.100
Our family forbids deceiving feelings.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.500
Am I that kind of man?

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.620
Am I?

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.460
Mom.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.980
I won't be like those stars.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.220
Besides,

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.780
I mean those words I say.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.660
Don't worry, Mom.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.140
I'll keep my distance from my fans.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.300
I belong to everyone.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.820
I can't be possessed by just one woman.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.060
Just give it a rest.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.280
You don't look like an idol,

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.940
but you've already got
the idol's burden.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.340
I thought you might get better,

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.580
but instead, you've regressed.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.380
What do you mean by this?

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.140
You're all here.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.240
Something big has happened.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.740
You simply can't believe it.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.340
Why are there so many people in front?

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.620
Why is the shop closed?

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.020
Are we not doing business anymore?

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.300
It's all because of Shen Gongcai's fans.

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.420
They're all his fans?

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.060
What about mine?

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.500
Dad, get to the point.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.460
Yes, yes.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.780
Yangyang and I

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.540
just saw

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.300
that the Princess's servants

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.660
sent Mr. Lin

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:36.700
back to his mansion.

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.100
From what we overheard,

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:41.220
it seems the Princess likes Mr. Lin.

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.180
What?

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.480
Grandpa, what does that mean?

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.720
Let's have an emergency meeting.

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.700
A meeting.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.880
Let's have a meeting.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.260
Speak up, everyone.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.860
Folks, listen to me first.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.660
Actually, I think

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.860
this might not be a bad thing.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.100
Think about it.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.290
If our ancestor gets together
with the Princess,

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:17.140
his status

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.140
would immediately be elevated, right?

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.180
Then we'd become descendants
of the Princess.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.660
That's a blessing
for his descendants, right?

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.660
Gongcai,

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.100
is your mind just a mess?

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.060
What's the matter?

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.260
Who are we?

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.100
We are the descendants
of Mr. Lin and Lady Shen.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.220
If Mr. Lin gets together
with the Princess,

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.100
can he still be good with Lady Shen?

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.820
If not,

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.220
the past would change.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.780
And the future would change too.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.020
Would there even be us then?

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.100
Yes, yes.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.820
I forgot about that.
That's not acceptable.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.460
They can't be good together.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.300
If they are,

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.300
we'll all cease to exist.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.900
If I'm gone,

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.740
what about my fans?

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.300
They would be so pitiful.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.260
You must've been deluded

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.420
by your fans.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.620
It's indeed like this.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.700
But according to the theories
in sci-fi movies,

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.300
history can't be changed.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.060
Since we already exist in the future,

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.100
it means our ancestor

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.980
will meet another Lady Shen

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.140
and marry her.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.700
Jicai,

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.980
she is the Princess after all.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.550
Her status is there.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.450
Moreover,

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:20.220
she wouldn't marry him

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.380
or limit his career development.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.900
All these benefits.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:24.820
The nature of humans...

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.940
Listen.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.500
It's hard to say.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.940
Our ancestor is not that kind of man.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.140
But what if

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.380
the Princess takes him by force?

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:34.860
By force?

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.500
Folks, I think

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.660
we are now at a critical moment.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.100
Everything that happens now

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.820
could affect the future.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:46.820
First,

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.700
we must put aside internal conflicts

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:49.860
and unite against the outside.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.020
We must resolutely prevent

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.660
our ancestor from going to the Princess.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.220
We must prevent him

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.700
from flying to a place
of greater happiness.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.820
Good point.
