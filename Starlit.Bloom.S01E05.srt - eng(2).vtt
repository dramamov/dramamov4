What brings you here today?

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.339
Do you have the day off?

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:16.560
I'm going on a business trip
for a month starting tomorrow.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.266
I wanted to come by
and see you before I leave.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.200
Work comes first.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.120
You keep bringing stuff

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.359
to the orphanage all the time.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:27.239
It's windy.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.319
You should button up.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:29.200
Don't catch a cold.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.159
This is my home.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.879
Besides, you raised me.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.040
They're my siblings.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.079
Or do you think

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.069
now that I'm grown up,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.577
I'm not allowed to come back home?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.680
Look at them having fun.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.309
Oh, that reminds me.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.311
I need to check if the gifts
for the kids are here yet.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.760
All right.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.040
Be careful.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.879
Slow down.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.079
Hey, bestie.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.680
I've been here for a while now.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.760
Where are you?

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.680
Well,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.919
I'm a bit tied up right now.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.159
I'll have someone bring them over, okay?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.400
Okay.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.879
Bye.

00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:21.000
The gifts are on their way.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.000
I took care
of the sketch situation for you.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.355
How are you going to thank me?

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:39.080
Is that getup necessary?

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.000
Su is my dearest bestie.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.800
If she found out I turned against her,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.840
I'd be dead meat.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.759
And yet you still helped me?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.240
You pretend to be nice to her.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.240
You're two-faced.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.680
You're her secret enemy.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680
Lies and slander!

00:03:04.911 --> 00:03:06.120
Fine, I'll tell you the truth.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.840
We grew up together.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.599
She's like family to me.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.599
I can't have her

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.560
hate my stepson.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.080
If you really want to get back into GL,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.039
I'll be kind enough to help you out.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.240
But understand this.

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.639
I'm always on Su's side.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.080
Let's cut

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.759
to the chase.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.400
Su only respects three kinds of people.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.280
First,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.159
those with ability.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.909
Second,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.955
those with determination.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.800
Third,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.560
those who are kind.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.560
This opportunity

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.719
is yours.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.879
Thanks.

00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:49.955
I know one good deed deserves another.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.520
I don't like owing people.

00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:53.150
Tell me. How do you
want me to repay you?

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.960
Just make sure
you attend your dad's wedding.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.439
Gold digger!

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.219
I knew you were trying to win me over
to get into the Lu family!

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.759
That's right. I'm not just gold-digging.

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.120
I'm after silver, credit cards,
and checks too.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.430
And someday, I'll be after
a little brother or sister for you too.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.439
Maybe even my bestie.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.680

She doesn't remember me anymore,

but whatever help I can give counts.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.155

Let's go!

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:52.360
Tang Baozhu,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.799
explain.

00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:55.240
If you trust me,

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:56.799
I can prove

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:57.759
Baozhu didn't lie.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:58.639
Hear that?

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:00.919
Starry Sea was designed by Liusu.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:03.240
Then why doesn't she remember me?

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.240
Because you take this very seriously,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.720
your amygdala and hippocampus

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:08.960
work together to imprint

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:10.759
these emotions deeply

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:12.000
into your memory.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.799
The more you recall

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:14.480
and reinforce it,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.519
the stronger it becomes.

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:17.919
Eight years ago,

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:20.000
you were just a teenager.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.840
What kind of impression
could she have of you?

00:10:21.844 --> 00:10:23.222
Besides, she probably doesn't want

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.360
to remember that time either.

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:33.840
What happened to her?

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:37.440
Social stereotypes caused

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.039
a self-perception bias,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.879
which created emotional stress.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.440
Who's next?

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.559
Me.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.679
Hello.

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:49.879
I'm Gu Liusu,
the designer interviewing today.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.039
Please take a look at my sketches.

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:56.879
Where are my sketches?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.240
Next.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.360
Please wait!

00:10:59.480 --> 00:10:59.960
Ma'am,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.360
I still have a copy on my phone.

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:03.159
Please check my phone...

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.159
Please.

00:11:11.355 --> 00:11:12.270
Wait to hear from me.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.720
Mr. Zhang,
these are the two shortlisted designers.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.039
This is the boss, Mr. Zhang.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.200
We just had a meeting to discuss.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.360
Miss Gu Liusu's designs

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.039
fit our company's vision better.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.960
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.480
Please prepare the contract.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:29.360
I must get going.

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:31.159
Yes!

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.879
Congratulations, Gu Liusu.

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:34.559
Pretty privilege is real.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.600
Does Mr. Zhang like you?

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:38.559
I want to be a pretty woman
in my next life.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.080
(Workplace gender discrimination)

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.679
(made Liusu start doubting herself.)

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:48.200
(She often wonders)

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.200
(if it's because
she's not professional enough)

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.639
(that people think that way.)

00:11:55.466 --> 00:11:57.155
She must have been
really torn up inside.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.039
If an experience is painful,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.320
anxiety-inducing,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.559
or stressful,

00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:05.080
some memories might
get suppressed subconsciously

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:08.159
because of the brain's
self-protection mechanism.

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:12.080
Thanks.

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:19.480
Gu Liusu.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.720
Will you give me another chance?

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.399
I know.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.639
You hate me

00:12:31.888 --> 00:12:33.360
because of the leaked sketch.

00:12:34.222 --> 00:12:36.030
I really didn't mean for that to happen.

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:38.159
No matter how you feel about me,

00:12:38.679 --> 00:12:40.039
I want to try to make things right.

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:43.240
I majored

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.840
in visual communication abroad,

00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:46.360
with a minor in jewelry design.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.519
I had full scholarships

00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:48.960
for four consecutive years.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.039
All this to say,

00:12:56.159 --> 00:12:57.720
I just want to tell you

00:12:58.688 --> 00:13:00.240
that I want to come back to GL

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.919
and take responsibility

00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:04.240
for what I caused.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.000
Please let me
be part of Starry Sea's design.

00:13:21.911 --> 00:13:23.790
If you really want
to go through with this,

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:27.519
design a necklace
inspired by ocean elements

00:13:27.822 --> 00:13:29.840
and include
a detailed explanation of your concept.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.240
Deal.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.200
Anyone else still needs a gift?
