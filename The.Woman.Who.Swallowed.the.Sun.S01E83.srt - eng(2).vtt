00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.010
(Episode 83)

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.080
Se Ri!

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.480
Min Se Ri.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.520
Min Se Ri, where are you?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.910
(Supply Room)

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.480
You shouldn't have pushed your luck.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.010
Think long and hard in there...

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.680
about what you took from me...

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.250
and what a huge mistake that was.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.560
I want you to stew on it
until it eats you alive.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.270
Open the door! Open up!

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.170
I said, open the door right now!

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.570
- Open the door!
- Scream all you want.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.440
- No one ever comes around here.
- I said, open the door!

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.280
But who knows?

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.610
If you're lucky,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.920
you might get out within a week.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.140
Is anyone out there?

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.310
Someone's trapped in here!
In here! There's someone in here, I said!

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.750
Hello! Is anyone out there?

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920
Hello!

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.380
She said she'd be right back.
What's going on?

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.430
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.330
Did something happen to her?

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.540
Excuse me, have you seen Lucia?
No, I mean...

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.780
- Has anyone seen the CEO?
- The CEO? She must be in her office.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.740
Obviously I'm asking
because she's not there.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.980
Excuse me, does anyone know
where the CEO is?

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.020
I'm not sure. We've been in the office
the whole time.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.790
There is one person
who just got back, though.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.390
That's right.
She left without saying where she went,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.360
and she was gone for a while.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.030
What? Am I not allowed a private life?

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.270
Min Kyung Chae,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.500
have you seen the CEO, by any chance?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.140
No, I haven't.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.510
You haven't?

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.780
So you're saying
you really haven't seen her?

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.280
How many times do I have to tell you?
I said I haven't.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.710
Where on earth could she be? Seriously.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.180
At this rate, we're going
to miss the meeting.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.890
The Doil Department Store meeting?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.520
That's just a provisional contract.
We need the final contract signed today.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.660
I know! That's why I'm trying
to find the CEO!

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.990
She definitely said she'd be right back.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.700
If she went off the grid right before
an important meeting, isn't it obvious?

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.530
She probably got scared
now that she's in the CEO's chair.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.600
It's not easy doing a job
she's not cut out for.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.640
Watch your mouth.
The CEO would never shirk her duties.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.180
Something must have happened to her.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.850
CEO this, CEO that.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.150
As if she's a real CEO.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.900
What's with him?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.400
Are you saying she's locked
in the supply room right now?

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.070
I'm not sure how long she'll last,
but she'll be in there for a while.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.310
So that's why Moon Tae Kyung was
frantically searching for her.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.480
Do you have any idea...

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.180
how hard I worked on the contract
with Doil Department Store?

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.920
I practically sold my soul
to land that provisional contract.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.290
They acted so high and mighty,
all because they're a Big Three store.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.790
Bragging that even if they're not
on our platform,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.830
their sales are already through the roof.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.600
I put up with all of that, flattered them,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.870
and finally got that provisional contract.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.170
And I'm supposed to just stand by
while that woman swoops in and takes it?

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.470
Wait, so what happens to our deal then?

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.110
It has to fall through.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.180
That's how it becomes
the new CEO's first official failure.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.380
I'll use that as an excuse for the board
to oust the incompetent new CEO,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.650
and then I can make my return.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
Wait, that was your plan all along?

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.320
If that deal goes south,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.190
someone's head is going to roll.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.690
Do you know how much money is at stake?

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.960
You never fail to impress.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.400
Did you really think
I would go down that easily?

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.470
Can I see the security footage?
I know you can't leave the building...

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.640
without going through the lobby,
and someone is missing.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.410
- Who are you looking for?
- Jung Lucia.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.280
I mean, the new CEO.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.390
It's confirmed,
she didn't leave the building.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.790
We can see her getting off the elevator
on the third floor,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.560
but after that...

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.560
The third floor?

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.470
Then why can't you see
what happened after that?

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.100
The camera on that floor
broke a few years ago.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.280
Since the third floor is just for supplies
and is mostly abandoned,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.880
I guess they don't think it's necessary,
so the repairs are a low priority.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.070
Is anyone out there?

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.030
Hello?

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.340
Someone's in here!

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.040
Hello?

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.180
Is anybody out there?

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.950
Someone's in here!

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.020
(Mechanical Room)

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.800
Where on earth could she be?

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.420
(Tae Kyung)

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.990
(Tae Kyung)

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.660
What's this doing here?

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.630
Then that means she's nearby.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.140
Don't tell me...

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.550
Please, open the door!

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.620
- Please!
- Lucia?

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.020
Tae Kyung?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.270
Tae Kyung, it's me! I'm in here!

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.330
Hang on. I'll get you out of there.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.510
(Supply Room)

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.830
Oh my gosh, what happened?
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.270
I'm okay.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.010
More importantly, what about the meeting?

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.040
There's still time.
Don't worry, we haven't missed it.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.740
That's a relief.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.320
Min Kyung Chae did this.
I saw a glimpse, but I'm sure it was her.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.750
She lured me here
and locked me in on purpose.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.460
What?

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.960
She wanted me to miss the meeting
so she could question my fitness as CEO.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.800
I can't believe her.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.500
How can someone be so malicious?

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.530
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.540
She's just like Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.900
Let's focus on the meeting for now.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.440
If we don't get
that contract signed today, it's over.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.640
She'll call a board meeting over this
and try to have me removed.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.810
We can't let that happen.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.780
We can confront her later.
Let's get this contract signed first.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.130
That was a close call.
Are you sure you don't need a doctor?

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.860
I'm just a little shaken, that's all.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.130
What would you have done
if he hadn't found you?

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.330
You definitely owe Tae Kyung
a lot for this.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.170
I should be going now.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.110
I have to let my team go home for the day.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.510
All right. I'll see you later.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.220
He must have been worried sick about you.
Look at him, he's a wreck.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.690
I guess I'm putting Tae Kyung
through a lot.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.930
If you know that,
then you should treat him well.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.930
Later, when all of this is over,

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.240
you should be with him
as Moon Tae Kyung and Jung Lucia.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.310
No, as Moon Tae Kyung and Baek Sul Hee.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.710
No, wait.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.440
Just start fresh as a man and a woman.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.910
I'll be rooting for you.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.210
I can't do that.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.120
I don't have the right to.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.600
What is this, a staring contest?
Why's everyone just watching each other?

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.430
It's past quitting time,
but Director Moon is running late.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.170
I wonder if the Doil Department Store deal
fell through.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.340
He's at a key meeting, and it feels wrong
to leave before he gets back.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.340
We've waited this long.
What's a little longer?

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.410
The Doil Department Store deal
is our project.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.050
If they close the deal,
we'll be the ones handling it.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.880
You're celebrating
before the deal is even done.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.050
And why shouldn't we get our hopes up?

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.330
Sorry for keeping you all late.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.830
Never mind that, how did it go?
Did you get the contract signed?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.130
Great work today, everyone.
You can all head home.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:13.040
- Right.
- Seriously. Did you get the contract?

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.910
See you all tomorrow.
Now, hurry and get home.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.480
Have a good night.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.550
So she was right.
Was I getting my hopes up for nothing?

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.080
Told you so.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.220
Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.620
Could you stay behind for a minute?

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.330
Aren't you curious about
the results of today's meeting?

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.070
Should I be?

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.530
Of course you should.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.200
You're on the online business team now.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.670
Is there anything more important to us
than this deal?

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.010
I wouldn't know.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.940
I still don't really feel like...

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.580
the online business team is my department.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.820
No, that's not it.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.690
It's because you knew
what would happen today.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.290
You already knew the outcome, didn't you?

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.690
What are you talking about?

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.260
I know you're upset about your position.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.330
But how could you
sabotage this contract...

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.560
and do something like that?

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.730
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.170
Someone could have gotten killed
because of what you did.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.240
Are you saying a person's life
means nothing to people like you?

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.280
It depends on whose life it is.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.210
A person's death can be meaningless
or it can be noble.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.020
What did you just say?
Why on earth would you...

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.250
abandon your own humanity like this?
Why? For what?

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.750
Shut your mouth! You don't know anything.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.290
What could you possibly know?

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.960
Shut my mouth?

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.270
This is as far as I'm going today.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.580
Consider yourself lucky.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.240
Got it?

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.350
If you'd been a man,

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.920
I would’ve beaten you to within an inch
of your life for what you did today.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.800
By the way, Lucia.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.240
There's something I'm dying to know.
Why did you go to that supply room?

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.380
I told you earlier.
I got a text from Se Ri.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.750
That's exactly why I'm asking.
What could that text have possibly said...

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.890
that made you skip an important meeting
and rush over there to save her?

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.720
This is exactly what I was worried about.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.590
People? No...

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.100
Let's not get philosophical.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:29.870
A mother with a heart like yours,
even if you take in your daughter's enemy,

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.740
if you live with her
and raise her like your own,

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.940
you're bound to develop a maternal bond.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.940
With someone to pour that love into,
how can a mother-daughter bond not form?

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.180
Don't say things like that!
Our Mi So would be upset to hear that.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.320
- Maternal feelings?
- Lucia.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.920
That's ridiculous. I'm telling you.
Even now, when I look at her,

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.490
I'm reminded of the day my Mi So died.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.660
Maternal feelings?

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.930
How could I possibly feel motherly
toward a girl like that?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.830
For me, my maternal love...

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.330
is reserved for my dear Mi So,
and that's all.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.150
A mother with a heart like yours,

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.790
even if you take in your daughter's enemy,

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.150
if you live with her
and raise her like your own,

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.360
you're bound to develop a maternal bond.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.360
No, why would I?

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.030
She's the reason Mi So is gone.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.940
Mom.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.700
Some water.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.440
Get it yourself.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.610
Mom, what's gotten into you today?

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.650
Why did you send that text earlier?

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.650
Is it fun for you to mess with people
with fake texts?

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.790
I didn't send you a text.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.230
Even though I have it right here from you?

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.530
No, it wasn't me.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.030
That's weird.

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.870
I swear, it wasn't me.
Why would I send something like this?

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.240
So you're saying you didn't send it?

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.110
I'm serious.
Why would I do a thing like that?

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.380
You were home all day today, right?

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.780
And you didn't see anyone else?

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.790
Then there's only one person in this house
who would do something like this.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.160
Se Ri, go on up to your room.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.800
Have a seat.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.240
I'll get straight to the point.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.010
I want you out of this house.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.610
What are you talking about?

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.110
Do I need to spell it out for you?

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.150
- I said, get out of this house!
- Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.590
Pack your bags and get out right now!

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.460
Why?

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.560
What did I do wrong?

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.900
- You really have to ask?
- Yes, I do.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.810
Tell me what on earth I did
to deserve this!

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.270
How despicable.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.340
Excuse me?

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:26.910
I said you're despicable.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.310
Sending a text like that
from Se Ri's phone.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.520
Is that any way
for a grown woman to behave?

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.150
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.060
I don't know
what's made you so angry, but...

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.330
- I'm being framed!
- Get out! Now!

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.130
No. I'm not leaving.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.500
I'm not leaving
until the chairman comes home.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.900
The chairman isn't coming home today.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.040
A friend's mother died.
He returns tomorrow.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.880
Just leave.
I'll explain everything to the chairman.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.940
I have served this family
for thirty years.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.050
- You can't just throw me out like this.
- Do you want to be dragged out?

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.150
Hey!

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.590
Are we really just going to
let her kick Manager Gong out?

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.360
The lady of the house is
telling her to leave.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.590
I know, but still.
Kicking her out overnight isn't right.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.360
You have to have some common courtesy.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.400
Kyung Chae won't stand for this
if she finds out.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.800
Of course. Manager Gong is her right hand.
She's not going to let this slide.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.740
So, should we try to
stop her from leaving?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.040
She'll just come back
once Kyung Chae gets here anyway.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.140
Right, darling. Let's stop her.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.140
Why don't we just stay out of it?

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.750
You two should just sit back
and enjoy the show.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.750
And what's that supposed to mean?

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.390
You're the one who said it.
You can't fight the tide.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.100
Wait, are you saying that Moon Tae Kyung
yelled at you and threatened you?

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.900
What, do you think I'm making it up?

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.810
- That bastard!
- That's not what's important right now.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.210
If Moon Tae Kyung was the one
who rescued her,

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.150
- then the Doil Department Store deal...
- But didn't that fall through?

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:46.950
We don't know that for sure yet.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.060
Yes, Manager Gong.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.630
Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.600
I've been kicked out.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.630
Kicked out?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.870
That woman told me to get out.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.800
She tells you to leave, so you just leave?

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.870
What was I supposed to do?
She looked like she'd tear my head off.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:14.910
Where are you right now?

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.650
You were told to leave.
What are you doing back here?

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.360
I'm the one who told her to come in.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.690
Manager Gong is like family to us.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.030
Like family, maybe, but she's not family.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:35.670
Get her out.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.240
I won't have a schemer pulling tricks
under my roof.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.010
She played a nasty little trick
using Se Ri's phone.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.080
Though I'm sure
someone else put her up to it.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.550
Thanks to her,

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.150
I was trapped in a warehouse
and nearly died.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.120
Manager Gong did all of that
on someone else's orders.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.220
Which, if you think about it,
makes the one who ordered it even worse.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.260
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.430
Don't go around accusing people
without any concrete proof.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.070
That's a bad habit to get into.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.900
What are you waiting for?
Go on and unpack.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.470
Where do you think you're going?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.940
I told you to go unpack.
What are you still doing here?

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.640
You're making a huge mistake.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.780
Do you think I'm just going
to let this slide?

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.510
And what if you don't?

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.380
What, you have proof or something?

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.790
Next time you want to get rid of someone,
make sure you have some concrete evidence.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.730
Let's go, Manager Gong.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.940
Enjoy your meal!

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.580
Yeon Ah,
who is from the same hometown as me.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.950
What are you so focused on?

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.450
The calendar.
My niece's birthday is coming up.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.420
And it looks like it's already next week.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.060
She's not your kid or your partner.
Why all the fuss over a niece?

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.930
To me, she's more than my own child.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.560
My, what a thing
for an unmarried woman to say.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.470
More than your own child?
That's not right.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.400
You should get married and have a baby.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:19.500
That's the real deal.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.170
But still, my niece is like
my own daughter.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.710
She's always seen me more as a mother
than an aunt.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.880
So how old is your niece?

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.050
She'd be 20, if she were still alive.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.320
Goodness, you mean
she's already passed away?

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.050
So young, too.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.960
My goodness!

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.320
Your poor sister.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.330
There's nothing more tragic than a mother
who has to bury her own child.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.500
So, speaking of which,
is it okay if I take a day off next week?

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.030
My sister and I need to go visit her.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.170
Of course, of course.
You take the day off.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.570
Hey now, young lady.
You know, we're so busy with customers.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.010
If you suddenly take off, it's going to be
a bit of a, you know, problem.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.650
You should find a temp to, you know,
cover for you before you go.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.880
Oh Pan Sool, enough with the "you knows."

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.320
You can't take your money to your grave.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:12.290
I keep telling you I'm taking it with me.
The Grim Reaper loves getting bribed.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.360
The king of the fiery pits loves
a good bribe!

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.060
Even in the fiery pits, money talks.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.130
Oh, for crying out loud!

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.660
Stop it, you two.
The customers are watching.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.100
Anyway, like I was saying,
I'm taking one day off next week.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.070
Right, you take the day off.
And you can go straight to the fiery pits!

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.470
You're coming with me.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.310
What are you talking about?
I'm going to the good place!

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.940
Then I'll go there with you.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.910
You got in so late last night,
I wasn't able to tell you.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.680
About the Doil Department Store contract.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.120
That's right. How did that turn out?

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.990
I'm sick of everyone asking me
about it everywhere I go.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.620
Doil Department Store is so
full of themselves.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.190
With their luxury wing and everything.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.290
They think they're the number one
department store in Korea or something.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:51.960
I closed the deal.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.460
You did?

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.400
Kyung Chae worked so hard on that
and only managed a provisional contract.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.170
Although it almost fell through.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.380
The truth is, I was locked
in a warehouse yesterday.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.510
Someone locked me in there...

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.610
to try and sabotage the deal.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.220
Who would do such a thing?

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.450
It couldn't be...

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.960
Someone didn't want me to get the credit
for closing the deal.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.090
And my collapse
during the live broadcast...

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.360
was also a deliberate incident.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.960
What do you mean by that?

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:42.280
They rigged the raffle on the livestream
so we'd pick the spicy seafood stew.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.280
They did it on purpose,
knowing I have a seafood allergy.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.220
As you can see,

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.990
it's designed so that it's impossible
to pick any of the other products.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.800
The shopping host scheduled for that day
suddenly went AWOL,

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.400
so I had no choice
but to do the taste test myself.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.070
Are you telling me my daughter Kyung Chae
is behind all of this?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.270
We found the shopping host
and confirmed everything.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.280
That little brat!

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.750
So, that brings me to my next point.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.550
I think it's time we made a decision...

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.750
about Kyung Chae's future with us.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.400
I know you've all been wondering...

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.330
about the Doil Department Store deal.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.330
We've secured the contract.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.270
Incredible!

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.180
I tried to give you every chance,

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.240
but I was clearly mistaken.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:52.050
I guess a leopard really
can't change its spots.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.720
You need to reflect on what you've done
and show some remorse.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.660
You need some time to do that,
Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:03.690
On that note,

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.000
I'd like to give you that time.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.270
Listen closely, Ms. Min Kyung Chae.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.270
This is an order from the CEO
of Mingang Distribution.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.110
You...

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.940
are fired.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.250
Fire me? Says who?

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.220
Whose company do you think this is?

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.290
You had until the end of the month
to resign with some dignity,

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.420
but clearly, that's not an option.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.730
You...

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.290
are fired. Effective immediately.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.210
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.400
Haven't you done enough?
Stop this. Right now.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.230
No. I'm just getting started.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:18.370
So, does this mean Jung Lucia is
calling the shots at Mingang now?

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.840
So you'd better grovel.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.540
It looks like Lucia thinks of Se Ri
as her own daughter.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.310
It's your birthday today?

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.810
Then again, who'd remember the birthday
of someone like me?

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.210
How can she and my Mi So share a birthday?

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.480
What is this fateful connection?

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.350
