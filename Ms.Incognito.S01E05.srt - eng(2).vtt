[Episode 5]

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.600
Oh, my.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.933
Your skin is so fair.

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.000
Oh my goodness.

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:13.233
It's been so long.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.000
My friend.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.400
My friend, what's going on here?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.100
Friend?

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.900
This is Baek Hye Ji.

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:50.767
My friend!

00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:52.900
You're still the same.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.533
Uh, I have something to talk about with my friend.

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:03.067
Oh, okay, go ahead.

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:06.933
Excuse me.

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.567
Yes?

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.967
You dropped something.

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:25.833
Something important.

00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:32.367
Oh! You're right.

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:35.900
How could you drop something so important?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.233
- People must be waiting.
- Yes.

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:41.467
Hurry up and go.

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:45.867
See you later.

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:50.533
Muchang Strawberries?

00:03:55.533 --> 00:03:58.300
How did you know I was here?

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.667
Did Ga Seon Yeong send you?

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:04.867
Yeong Ran, there are no secrets in this world.

00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:07.333
And you're being so cold-hearted.

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:09.867
What's with Ga Seon Yeong?

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:11.733
She's your daughter.

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:16.200
Just kidding.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.700
But if the professor finds out you're here,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.667
she said she'd reward me handsomely.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.300
That part is true.

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:36.867
What do you really want, Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:39.533
Why should I care?

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:43.433
The reward is what the giver decides.

00:04:44.672 --> 00:04:48.367
Miss, all is ready!

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:50.767
Friend, what day is it today?

00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:53.533
I couldn't even eat a meal
coming all the way here.

00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:55.167
Great!

00:04:56.267 --> 00:04:59.200
Let's finish our talk before leaving.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.267
What talk?

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:02.133
How much do you want?

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:04.933
How much will it take for you
to shut up and leave quietly?

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:10.067
Our Yeong Ran

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:14.233
has become a chaebol wife,
but you haven't changed at all.

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:16.133
No,

00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:19.067
should I call you Ms. Bu Se Mi now?

00:05:19.067 --> 00:05:21.167
Answer me first.

00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:23.100
Tell me what you want.

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:27.967
A billion won?

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:29.567
Are you serious?

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:31.633
No.

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:33.233
Ten billion won?

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.233
You want to die, huh?

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:38.300
Yeong Ran.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.300
You're being awfully casual with me now.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.233
Yeong Ran, I told you.

00:05:44.233 --> 00:05:47.100
Let's eat, drink coffee,
and watch movies together.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.300
That's all I want.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.033
Of course, you'll pay for everything.

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:54.867
Now, we're really friends from today, right?

00:05:59.267 --> 00:06:05.200
Or should I have a serious talk
with the Muchang strawberry guy?

00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:13.533
I've made a friend now too.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.100
I'm leaving now. I'm hungry.

00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:22.600
Please don't do anything foolish.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.967
I'm asking you, friend.

00:06:29.633 --> 00:06:31.267
Okay.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.500
How in the world did Baek Hye Ji find me?

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.367
Get ready, folks.

00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:01.800
She's out!

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.567
She's here. Get ready.

00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:07.400
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.933
Welcome!

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:16.733
Well, you are treating us.

00:07:16.733 --> 00:07:18.433
[Welcome, Ms. Bu Se Mi]
We couldn't just stand by.

00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:21.300
Meals and gifts under 50,000 won
don't violate ethics laws.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.367
So this banner

00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:24.800
cost 40,000 won from
our regular vendor for village events,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.000
and these fireworks were delivered
in the early morning for 9,800 won.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Total 49,800 won. A safe solution.

00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:39.800
Ms. Bu Se Mi, this is our heartfelt gesture.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.000
We love you.

00:07:43.037 --> 00:07:44.888
Fireworks!

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.433
Everyone, let's eat.

00:07:56.433 --> 00:07:58.167
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.667
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:01.667
Please have your meal
before the noodles get soggy.

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:03.533
Sit here.

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:06.033
Miss, look at that bounce house over there.

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:08.133
The kids love it.

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:09.767
You should check it out.

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:11.167
Come this way.

00:08:11.167 --> 00:08:13.033
- Friend.
- Wait, Ms. Bu's friend.

00:08:13.033 --> 00:08:15.267
Join us for a meal.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.533
Wait, did you come all the way
from Seoul to Muchang just to see her?

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:23.900
Everyone, having fun?

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.633
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:08:25.633 --> 00:08:27.067
Miss Bu Se Mi is the best!

00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:30.300
- Miss Bu Se Mi is the best!
- Miss Bu Se Mi is the best!

00:08:32.733 --> 00:08:34.700
The best!

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.033
Miss, today feels like my birthday.

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:39.067
This is so much fun.

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:42.733
This is for you.

00:08:46.112 --> 00:08:49.504
I'm back, guys!

00:08:49.504 --> 00:08:51.392
Are you ready?

00:08:51.392 --> 00:08:54.153
Come on, climb up.

00:08:58.133 --> 00:08:59.767
What?

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:01.567
Why is the light on?

00:09:14.767 --> 00:09:16.867
No.

00:09:16.867 --> 00:09:19.967
Baek Hye Ji!

00:09:19.967 --> 00:09:21.333
[Not on my side: It's going well, right?]

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:23.200
It's going well, right?

00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:26.867
Oh, it looks delicious.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.300
Wow, you've worked so hard preparing for today.

00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:33.800
- Ju Won's father.
- Yes.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.233
We're not just here to eat today, right?

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.300
Shouldn't we verify her?

00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:43.767
Wait a second.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.533
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't we verify her?

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:57.200
Speaking from a police perspective,
people aren't always trustworthy.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.000
Do we really need to verify her?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.700
She seems fine to me.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.767
Hey, Jeong Hwa.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:04.900
You know you're bad at judging people, right?

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.333
Isn't that right, PTA President?

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:08.100
But she's kind.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.600
Is she?

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.133
By the way, Miss.
Do you prefer jjamppong or jajangmyeon?

00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:19.633
I enjoy both equally.

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:21.400
That's hard to choose.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.200
Mixed noodles. Just choose mixed noodles.

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:29.533
Enjoy your meal.

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:34.967
Miss.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.733
This tastes great.

00:10:38.733 --> 00:10:40.033
- Enjoy your meal.
- Yes.

00:10:40.033 --> 00:10:44.133
Well, my younger sister graduated from
Iseon Women's University's business school.

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:47.900
When I went to her graduation,
the building was really cool.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.100
Oh.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.633
The business school building?

00:10:51.633 --> 00:10:52.667
Yeah.

00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:55.800
The windows there are really big, right?

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:01.100
When I used to attend classes there,
the sunlight would pour in,

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.367
and I would get really sleepy.

00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:04.700
That's right.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.833
I think my younger sister, Seung Hee,
also mentioned something like that.

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:10.000
Wait, do you know Pyo Seung Hee?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.433
She's a reporter at GNA now.

00:11:13.933 --> 00:11:15.867
Pyo Seung Hee.

00:11:16.867 --> 00:11:19.200
I only know her face.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.267
Seung Hee had such pretty eyes, remember?

00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:26.033
Yeah, that's right.

00:11:26.033 --> 00:11:28.700
Oh, Lord.

00:11:30.033 --> 00:11:32.600
Please finish your meal quickly.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.933
Did Seung Hee have beautiful eyes?

00:11:34.933 --> 00:11:36.833
She suddenly became prettier.

00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:39.467
During the summer vacation of 3rd grade.

00:11:39.467 --> 00:11:42.300
Oh right.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.467
Miss, then Seung Hee...

00:11:45.467 --> 00:11:47.867
Right, right. Jeong Woo.

00:11:47.867 --> 00:11:49.100
Everyone.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.000
I have some good news to share today.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.667
The rumor that Ms. Bu Se Mi has come to

00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:58.267
our Muchang Iseon Kindergarten has spread
throughout the whole town of Muchang,

00:11:58.267 --> 00:12:02.167
and we plan to have more students
starting next week.

00:12:04.733 --> 00:12:07.467
Miss, please say a few words.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.267
Although this is a welcome party for me,

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:19.267
I'm so grateful for the wholehearted welcome
you've all given me.

00:12:19.267 --> 00:12:22.200
I actually heard some bad things

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.800
about the previous teachers from Ju Won's father.

00:12:26.567 --> 00:12:31.567
I understand you couldn't open up to me
because the children were hurt by them.

00:12:31.567 --> 00:12:35.500
But I'm definitely different from them.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.933
I always keep my promises.

00:12:40.733 --> 00:12:42.300
Please watch and see.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.700
Alright, let's watch.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.767
- Bu Se Mi!
- Bu Se Mi!

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:51.100
Now, shall we all have a drink?

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.533
- Yes.
- Let's drink.

00:12:52.533 --> 00:12:54.333
- Fill the glasses.
- Okay.

00:12:59.733 --> 00:13:01.033
Ms. Bu's friend?

00:13:01.033 --> 00:13:02.833
- Ms. Bu's friend?
- Huh?

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:07.233
Wait, so you two are alumni
from Iseon Women's University?

00:13:07.233 --> 00:13:09.067
The early childhood education department?

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:11.133
Ah...

00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:13.900
- We...
- I majored in ballet.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.433
- Wow.
- Ballet?

00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:16.833
Should I show you?

00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:18.500
Right now?

00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:25.067
Oh my, oh my.

00:13:27.533 --> 00:13:29.133
Wow.

00:24:48.167 --> 00:24:53.333
So Yeong unnie, your coffee.

00:24:55.533 --> 00:24:57.233
So Yeong left earlier.

00:24:57.233 --> 00:24:59.567
But, you said to use the name often.

00:24:59.567 --> 00:25:00.767
My, you're peculiar.

00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:01.800
So Yeong unnie.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.200
I said So Yeong left already.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.267
Ms. Kim So Yeong?

00:25:12.067 --> 00:25:14.567
Your face looks unfamiliar.

00:25:15.533 --> 00:25:17.167
Have I...

00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:20.467
ever borrowed money from you?

00:25:23.433 --> 00:25:26.933
Or bought vinyl flooring?

00:25:26.933 --> 00:25:29.100
Flooring...

00:25:30.833 --> 00:25:33.067
If neither...

00:25:33.067 --> 00:25:34.300
Then you're worse.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.333
Oh, my.

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.400
Unnie.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.800
You got a sharp tongue, huh?

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.567
Walk slowly!

00:25:42.233 --> 00:25:44.467
You'll hurt your joints.

00:26:12.833 --> 00:26:15.800
- Kids, let's go.
- I made this myself. Share it with Dong Min.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.633
Miss, Miss.

00:26:17.633 --> 00:26:19.300
We'll head in first now.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.633
- Going home?
- Yes.

00:26:20.633 --> 00:26:21.867
Ah, okay.

00:26:21.867 --> 00:26:24.267
- Did you have fun?
- Let's go.

00:26:25.367 --> 00:26:26.567
Miss.

00:26:26.567 --> 00:26:30.133
You know how grateful we are that you came, right?

00:26:31.433 --> 00:26:32.633
Miss.

00:26:32.633 --> 00:26:35.467
Please take good care of our kids from now on.

00:26:35.467 --> 00:26:38.467
Please look after our Jenny
and Seo Hyeon too, Miss.

00:26:38.467 --> 00:26:40.333
Thank you for the meal today.

00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:41.400
We'll head back now.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.800
Yes, go home quickly.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.800
- We'll be going in.
- Okay.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.467
- Thank you.
- Go on inside.

00:26:45.467 --> 00:26:46.900
- Goodbye.
- I'll go in now.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.600
- Please go in.
- Goodbye.

00:26:50.367 --> 00:26:52.400
Jeon Dong Min.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.200
Seems like you've got competition now?

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.933
What do you mean?

00:26:58.067 --> 00:27:02.700
Who in Muchang could stand up
to Seong Tae so confidently?

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.800
Actually, everyone here is tied to
Seong Tae through interests,

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.333
so they say 'yes' even when they hate it.

00:27:11.133 --> 00:27:14.767
She's truly an unpredictable person.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.267
Look at this.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.733
The village chief gave me this before leaving.

00:27:21.733 --> 00:27:22.900
Let's have one more drink.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.267
Sis, you should drink with us too.

00:27:25.267 --> 00:27:27.100
You guys drink among yourselves.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.800
I have to close up the shop.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.833
Oh my, Hae Na.

00:27:30.833 --> 00:27:33.500
Mom drank too much, so I can't carry you home.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.367
Alright, let's go home and sleep.

00:27:36.367 --> 00:27:38.233
My daughter, can you walk?

00:27:38.233 --> 00:27:40.733
- Go carefully, sis.
- Yeah, I'm going.

00:27:40.733 --> 00:27:42.000
Goodnight, Uncle.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.900
- Goodbye, Hae Na.
- Bye.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.533
Oh, Miss, goodbye.

00:27:47.533 --> 00:27:49.133
Let's go.

00:27:55.733 --> 00:27:57.467
Ms. Hye Ji.

00:27:58.333 --> 00:27:59.367
What?

00:27:59.367 --> 00:28:03.933
How about we share a glass
of ginseng liquor together?

00:28:03.933 --> 00:28:06.133
Speaking of this ginseng liquor,

00:28:06.133 --> 00:28:08.533
since it's made with six-year-old ginseng roots,

00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:11.533
just one sip will make your body temperature...

00:28:11.533 --> 00:28:13.000
This, it's really good.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.667
Your temperature spikes?

00:28:16.833 --> 00:28:19.067
Can't do that.

00:28:19.067 --> 00:28:20.067
Huh?

00:28:20.067 --> 00:28:24.200
Because if I get cute,

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.900
it'll be a big problem.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.067
Can't do that.

00:28:27.067 --> 00:28:28.467
No, I can't...

00:28:28.467 --> 00:28:29.500
That would be dangerous.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.900
- That's really dangerous.
- I'm in danger.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.667
I can't resist cute things.

00:28:32.667 --> 00:28:34.667
I can't handle cute stuff at all.

00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:37.233
You're already cute enough.
What's with making it worse?

00:28:37.233 --> 00:28:40.833
- You're dangerous.
- Dangerous things are bad.

00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:41.967
Shall we open it?

00:28:41.967 --> 00:28:43.267
- Shall we open it?
- Shall we?

00:28:43.267 --> 00:28:44.900
Wait.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
- Why? Please.
- Wait a second, friend.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.500
You seem way too drunk right now.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.133
- No.
- We'll go in first.

00:28:51.133 --> 00:28:52.467
We're too tired.

00:28:52.467 --> 00:28:53.800
It seems like she's in good condition.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.867
No, Yeong Ran.

00:28:56.567 --> 00:28:58.767
- Feeling sick?
- I'm just...

00:28:58.767 --> 00:29:00.967
Today, I'm just going to...

00:29:03.033 --> 00:29:05.167
I'll try being cute.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.333
You are gonna get all cute.

00:29:09.333 --> 00:29:12.167
You are gonna get all cute.

00:29:13.033 --> 00:29:14.800
You are gonna get all cute.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.367
- Like it?
- Like it.

00:29:16.367 --> 00:29:17.400
I like it.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.733
- You're really...
- Me?

00:29:19.733 --> 00:29:22.067
- You're dead.
- I'm dead, really?

00:29:22.067 --> 00:29:26.233
Her friend's so cute. She's my ideal type.

00:29:26.233 --> 00:29:28.200
She's cute?

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.767
Go home and sleep.

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:31.867
I'm going to put Ju Won to sleep.

00:29:33.367 --> 00:29:35.900
And take care of her when you come in.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.933
Her mouth's going numb.

00:29:36.933 --> 00:29:38.300
Why?

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.267
Her mouth is already going numb.

00:29:41.267 --> 00:29:43.333
Take off your wig before sleeping.

00:29:43.333 --> 00:29:45.433
Not taking it off to sleep?

00:29:46.533 --> 00:29:48.533
By the way, my friend!

00:29:48.533 --> 00:29:52.833
What's the Muchang strawberry guy like?

00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:56.000
Back in Seoul I couldn't even speak to him.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.367
He's the most dangerous person in Muchang.

00:29:59.933 --> 00:30:02.300
So you should be careful too, Baek Hye Ji.

00:30:05.767 --> 00:30:09.867
I knew he was dangerous.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.167
He's super lethal.

00:30:19.133 --> 00:30:23.433
Berry, berry, strawberry pie.

00:30:48.967 --> 00:30:51.100
I've never used this before.

00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:54.067
But this thing

00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:59.067
can pierce someone's skull.

00:30:59.067 --> 00:31:00.900
Right, Ms. Kim So Yeong?

00:31:03.133 --> 00:31:05.033
I don't know about that.

00:31:05.033 --> 00:31:08.233
What exactly do you want, Vice President?

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.667
I keep asking you, right?

00:31:13.667 --> 00:31:17.267
Who got you two jobs?

00:31:17.267 --> 00:31:18.267
At our factory.

00:31:18.267 --> 00:31:20.133
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:31:20.133 --> 00:31:23.567
A lawyer came and told me
to do this or go to prison.

00:31:23.567 --> 00:31:26.200
Wasn't it Kim Yeong Ran?

00:31:28.133 --> 00:31:30.033
Do you like Yeong Ran?

00:31:30.033 --> 00:31:34.433
Why keep looking for Yeong Ran since earlier?

00:31:34.433 --> 00:31:38.000
You two aren't involved, are you?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.300
Not me, but with my father.

00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:42.967
If it's your father...

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:44.600
Darn it.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.000
Are you genuinely asking because you don't know?

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.467
I'm asking because I don't know!

00:31:48.467 --> 00:31:52.633
Your darn daughter Kim Yeong Ran
married Chairman Ga Sung Ho.

00:31:53.533 --> 00:31:55.933
Haven't you seen the news?

00:31:55.933 --> 00:31:57.600
Oh my.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.933
Was this my lottery jackpot?

00:31:59.933 --> 00:32:01.700
That's insane!

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.933
That gold digger?

00:32:02.933 --> 00:32:04.167
Oh goodness.

00:32:04.167 --> 00:32:06.067
How can a mother call her daughter a gold digger?

00:32:06.067 --> 00:32:08.067
Ugh, seriously...

00:32:08.067 --> 00:32:11.933
Everyone calls her that. Why shouldn't I?

00:32:11.933 --> 00:32:15.533
But if my daughter's Chairman Ga Sung Ho's wife,

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.533
then you and I are now...

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.933
In-laws?

00:32:21.933 --> 00:32:24.233
In-laws?

00:32:24.233 --> 00:32:27.467
If Yeong Ran's his mother,

00:32:27.467 --> 00:32:30.567
you and him aren't in-laws.

00:32:30.567 --> 00:32:33.000
It's grandson and grandmother.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.600
Legally speaking.

00:32:35.733 --> 00:32:37.100
Oh.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.767
Right.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.000
In-laws, yep.

00:32:42.667 --> 00:32:43.933
In-laws.

00:32:43.933 --> 00:32:46.033
You really don't know where your daughter is?

00:32:46.033 --> 00:32:49.067
- Grandmother.
- Darn it.

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:52.200
Didn't you chaebols even investigate that?

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.100
I cut ties with Yeong Ran long ago.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:01.667
How is it that these things are the same
for both wealthy and poor families?

00:33:01.667 --> 00:33:03.367
Right, in-law?

00:33:04.033 --> 00:33:05.667
Exactly.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.433
In-law buddy.

00:33:09.433 --> 00:33:13.767
I might find out where Yeong Ran is.

00:33:13.767 --> 00:33:15.233
You know how?

00:33:15.233 --> 00:33:17.000
If there's a way?

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.433
Then what will you do for me?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.667
Wait, in-law.

00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:28.000
Trying to profit by selling your daughter?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.667
Since family's asking to find her,

00:33:31.633 --> 00:33:34.633
I might help a little.

00:33:34.633 --> 00:33:36.867
Right? Between us?

00:33:38.967 --> 00:33:41.167
That's right.

00:33:41.167 --> 00:33:43.000
That much is possible between us.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.933
But, in-law.

00:33:46.933 --> 00:33:48.233
Huh?

00:33:48.233 --> 00:33:50.167
Why are you suddenly

00:33:51.633 --> 00:33:55.867
using informal language and causing a fuss?

00:33:57.633 --> 00:34:01.000
You really make me want to kill you.

00:34:07.033 --> 00:34:10.133
Hey, get someone to follow Lee Don.

00:34:11.567 --> 00:34:13.300
Hey.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.967
You watch him.

00:34:46.267 --> 00:34:48.200
What are you doing now?

00:34:48.867 --> 00:34:51.833
We still haven't
finished our talk yesterday, right?

00:34:51.833 --> 00:34:53.533
What about?

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.533
We talked about everything yesterday.

00:34:56.533 --> 00:34:57.933
What exactly did we talk about?

00:34:57.933 --> 00:34:59.967
You know, when I pushed you.

00:34:59.967 --> 00:35:02.067
You want to discuss that now?

00:35:02.067 --> 00:35:03.433
You're heading to the greenhouse, right?

00:35:03.433 --> 00:35:05.167
Let's finish talking there.

Please listen and don't misunderstand.

00:35:35.167 --> 00:35:37.700
I genuinely have no interest in you.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.733
That's why I said it meant nothing.

00:35:40.733 --> 00:35:43.667
But I'm actually interested in you.

00:35:43.667 --> 00:35:45.333
What?

00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:48.733
Is that truly the reason?

00:35:48.733 --> 00:35:49.900
Yes.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.333
Because you doubt me too much.

00:35:53.367 --> 00:35:55.533
So you tried to kiss me?

00:35:55.533 --> 00:35:58.167
Kiss? When did I?

00:35:58.167 --> 00:36:00.067
You were trying to use money
to win people's hearts,

00:36:00.067 --> 00:36:01.800
and since money doesn't work on me,

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.767
you tried to use your looks

00:36:03.767 --> 00:36:06.367
and approached me yesterday.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.100
I see how you might think that way.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.267
Well, Ju Won's father,

00:36:21.267 --> 00:36:23.900
you seem deeply mistaken about something.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.100
Since you kept blocking my path,

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.667
I instinctively pushed you in panic.

00:36:30.667 --> 00:36:32.133
You should've just said that.

00:36:32.133 --> 00:36:35.200
I didn't know you would
misunderstand it this much.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.533
You have a kid, and yet you're surprisingly naive.

00:36:39.533 --> 00:36:43.200
Not naive, just honest.

00:36:47.933 --> 00:36:51.233
So, all misunderstandings are cleared?

Ah, be careful when picking them.

00:39:31.033 --> 00:39:32.733
They wilt fast if the stems fall off.

00:39:32.733 --> 00:39:34.533
And it lowers their market value.

Strawberries are sensitive
to temperature and humidity.

00:40:17.967 --> 00:40:20.867
But this greenhouse stands firm,

00:40:23.067 --> 00:40:25.000
It protects them from all that.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.433
you seem to have a good heart.

00:59:58.667 --> 01:00:00.833
- Let me see.
- What is it?

01:00:00.833 --> 01:00:02.267
Oh, nice!

01:00:02.267 --> 01:00:03.600

When it comes to ramyeon, red ramyeon.

01:00:05.267 --> 01:00:08.500
Ga Sung Ho, late chairman of Gaseong Group,
famous for ramyeon miracles,

[Gaseong Group faced scandals]
has been beset by continual controversy.

01:00:18.267 --> 01:00:21.433
Now Vice President Ga Seon Woo,
a potential successor,

01:00:21.433 --> 01:00:26.267
is attempting to sell the company
to foreign private equity funds.

01:00:26.267 --> 01:00:30.033
GNA's exclusive reporter
Pyo Seung Hee is joining us live.

01:00:30.033 --> 01:00:32.267
Recently, Gaseong Group's Ga Seon Woo

01:00:32.267 --> 01:00:35.733
has been acquiring company shares
under borrowed names

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:38.800
with Mr. Kim who runs foreign private funds.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.900
Circumstances have been uncovered indicating

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:47.633
that after becoming CEO, Ga Seon Woo
planned to transfer all of his shares

01:00:48.267 --> 01:00:51.800
to the foreign private equity fund.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.967
So you'll give me 600 billion won

01:00:54.967 --> 01:00:58.367
for acquiring Gaseong Ramyeon?

01:00:58.367 --> 01:01:02.967
Even if you become the chairman,
everyone knows Ga Seon Yeong pulls the strings.

01:01:02.967 --> 01:01:04.333
Better sell than be a puppet CEO...

01:01:04.333 --> 01:01:06.600
Wow, Seon Woo looks good on screen.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.867
Hey, is this true?

01:01:07.867 --> 01:01:08.967
Your sister will beat you up for this.

01:01:08.967 --> 01:01:11.767
Oh, shut up!

01:01:11.767 --> 01:01:14.733

may I help you?

01:01:35.467 --> 01:01:36.667
With what?

01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:38.567
Unimaginable wealth.

01:01:38.567 --> 01:01:42.833
Of course I need to survive to inherit it,
but I want to help this much.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:44.567
How?

Yes.

Even without adding dried pollack,

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:20.167
if you cook it following the recipe
on the back of the package, it tastes best.

01:02:20.167 --> 01:02:23.067
Countless researchers spent years developing this.

01:02:23.067 --> 01:02:25.700
Jeez, taste it before you talk.

in that red noodle company.

But the vice president keeps causing scandals,
so the stock's crashing hard.
