00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.410
Commander Gu said

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.930
this shelter is extremely well hidden,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.100
even the household staff
don't know about it.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.930
So everyone can relax.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.900
Please, don't hurt me!

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.380
Miss Meng.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.820
I'm not a traitor to the nation!

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.540
Please!

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.100
Miss Meng.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.900
Please spare me!

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.380
Don't be afraid.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.820
I'm not a traitor.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.820
I swear, I'm not.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.610
Miss Meng, I'm Xian Biyun.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.540
Don't be afraid.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.610
It's over now.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.260
I swear,
I'm not a traitor to the nation.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.890
Alright.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.130
It's alright now.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.100
I'm not a traitor to the nation.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.340
It's okay, don't be scared.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.980
I truly am not a traitor to the nation.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.260
It's alright.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.010
Miss Meng.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.260
I have a younger sister named Hongyu.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.820
She's about your age.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.260
But…

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.220
she's got a lot more courage.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.220
Do you want to hear her story?

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.260
In my whole life,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.890
I've only done two things.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.010
I joined the Northern Expedition

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.980
and the War of Resistance Against Japan.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.380
I also raised two wonderful children.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.220
Both are upright and decent kids.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.380
Father,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.940
yet I'm still seen as incapable.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.220
This has nothing to do with you.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.500
I know what kind of temper
Chairman Chiang has.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.130
From the moment
I handed in my resignation,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.100
I knew our family
would face this calamity.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.140
Isn't this exactly why you refused

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.460
to step back into the spotlight?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.250
I stayed out of it

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.810
because of this very reason.

This...

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.370
It looks like Bingqing's handwriting.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.050
I knew you'd recognize it.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.930
Then...

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.700
what's with the bloodstains on it?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.980
Wasn't it during the march

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.170
that she suddenly had a heart attack?

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.660
On March 24, 1936,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.530
the Songhu Garrison Command
ordered the Shanghai police

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.300
to deploy 500 military police

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.770
to surround Fudan University students
in the dead of night.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.730
Six people were arrested.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.500
The next day, they arrested the head

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.210
of the Student National
Salvation Association.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.980
Clashes broke out
between the police and the students.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.660
Over 20 shots were fired on the spot.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.770
More than 20 students were injured.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.580
One of them

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.180
died the next day from severe injuries.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.660
The warning shots

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.260
were under the Nationalist Government's
just enacted

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.620
Emergency Punishment Law
for Maintaining Public Order.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.300
The entire operation was planned by me.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.540
But I never imagined

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.540
that she...

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.330
was right there among the students.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.860
From that day on,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.100
I had nightmares every night.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.660
I just couldn't figure out

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.210
why did it have to be Bingqing who died?

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.860
Later, it was...

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.890
It was Gu who reminded me.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.660
He said,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.620
"Master,

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.210

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.180

From that day on,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.100
I kept wanting to resign.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.740
But the nation was weak
and enemies strong,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.330
so I couldn't leave.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.210
In these past ten years,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.980
I've watched our country

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.540
fall apart day by day.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.540
If Bingqing saw the scene today,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.660
would she think
her sacrifice was worth it?

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.740
What about me?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.740
All these years,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.500
from beginning to end,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.500
my faith and my choices,

along with how I raised you,

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.860
were all wrong.

Yangshan.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.540
Maybe I really took the wrong path.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.570
But I've come to the end of it.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.500
It's time for me to step back.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.450
But you're different.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.210
You're just getting started.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.450
You need to think through

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.060
which path you'd choose.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.300
Don't let the Gu family's legacy
hold you down.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.450
Father, I've thought it through.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.730
Every generation

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.940
has its own road to walk.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.450
I won't

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.210
and I can't

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.730
follow your exact footsteps.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.330
But in the Gu family,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.940
we've never raised a quitter.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.780
Reporting, Deputy Chief.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.020
We didn't find anyone.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.610
No way.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.900
We've searched every corner.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.490
We even checked every crack
in the ground.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.780
There's really nothing.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.540
We need to search every house

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.540
of the Gu family in Shanghai.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.180
One by one.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.420
Yes.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.660
Chief Luo.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.380
Have you found them?

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.780
You haven't found them yet,

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.610
but I know very well

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.020
that you're on official duty.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.610
I should have fully cooperated just now.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.380
I acted on impulse earlier. I'm sorry.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.970
Please also help me tell Secretary Liu

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.140
that I sincerely apologize.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.260
Just speak your mind.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.210
Just now, my father

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.330
gave me a lesson.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.330
He also told me off.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.490
Said I was way too reckless

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.490
and too impulsive,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.780
that I should think twice before acting,

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.850
and know how to set my priorities.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.020
Most importantly,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.210
I have to follow the Chief's orders

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.940
and instructions from my superiors.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.250
So I just wanted to apologize to you.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:22.770
I'm sorry.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.490
Let's go.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:44.420
Move!

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.650
Take care, Deputy Chief Luo.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.890
Did Miss Hongyu die?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.060
She went down fighting alongside
Japanese soldiers.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.890
If it weren't for her,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.370
Ding Yi might not have stayed.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.100
And what happened after

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.650
might never have happened.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.890
Why?

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.180
What did she do wrong?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.700
And what did I do wrong?

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.300
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.100
What's wrong

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.770
is this world.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.580
Then in this world,

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.770
why do we have to live so hard?

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.130
Life is hard.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.420
So we have to fight for change

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.580
and head toward a new China.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.820
Inspector Liu will be here
in a few hours.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.730
This time,

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.010
it's your only chance to leave Shanghai.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.060
You need to get in that car fast.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.530
Let's go together.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.420
I know,

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.700
you've wanted to leave for a long time.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.060
You were just waiting for an invitation.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.180
Five years ago,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.890
you were the one who invited me

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.820
to join the Sword Thrust Operation.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.580
And today,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.940
it's my turn to invite you

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:37.940
to join us.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.820
Back then, we fought side by side,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.370
took down Takeda,

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:44.820
took down Sasaki,

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.700
and even Liang Jingyuan.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.100
From now on,

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.850
we should keep working together

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.530
with other comrades

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.460
to protect our new life under the sun.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.820
Is part of your mission

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.700
to win me over too?

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.300
Not really.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.130
Actually, over the years,

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:06.650
I often thought about

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.700
how we fought side by side back then.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.060
Ding Yi, actually,

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.580
I've wanted to find you for a long time.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.770
I wanted to walk the same path as you.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.610
Because I believe the road you've chosen

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.580
leads to a brighter

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.580
and a clearer future.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.700
But…

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.810
my father's already getting old.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:34.930
And in the past few years,

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.420
he's been holding an important position
in the Party-State.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.060
If I had gone to see you rashly,

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:42.740
my father would...

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.340
But now, things have changed.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.180
He's handed in his resignation.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.340
And tomorrow, he's heading overseas.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.490
Just like I told you earlier,

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.100
I've got nothing holding me back now.

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.290
When did you start to waver?

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.250
When Cao Yuanzhong…

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.090
turned and fled on the battlefield.

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.770
And when I found out Uncle Gu

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.700
was with the Communist Party.

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:24.810
And when Chairman Chiang

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.860
launched the New Fourth Army Incident

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.770
and when Chongqing

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.660
spared Liang Jingyuan's life

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.220
for the sake of their own interests.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.090
It turns out, all these years

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:40.530
the one pretending to be blind

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:42.730
was you.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.620
Alright, enough talking.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:52.380
You're coming with us.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.900
We're going to Yan'an together.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.090
You still have to be my best man.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.090
Do you remember

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.530
what I told you

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.860
when we were in Sanyangli

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.090
sharing the same bed?

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.010
Once the War of Resistance is over

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.700
we'll find a place
with hills and rivers.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.250
You'd bring Miss Meng over

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.730
and we'd be neighbors.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.770
If you run out of cooking oil,
just come borrow from me.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.420
If I run out of flour,
I'll pop over to your place.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.220
When we both have kids in the future,

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.420
we can arrange for them
to be childhood sweethearts.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.490
If they're all girls or all boys,
it's fine.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.420
We'll just have them sworn in
as best friends.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.490
I really look forward to that day.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.940
And I believe it won't be far away.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.940
But Ding Yi, not right now.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.250
You still have a mission.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:50.900
Hand it over to me.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:52.980
I'll take care of the mission for you.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.490
Tell me how to reach your team.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.180
Then you and Ms. Xian can head to Yan'an

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.770
and hold your wedding there.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.700
Leave everything here to me.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.220
I know Shanghai better than you do.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.700
Tracking down the doctors
will be easier for me.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.380
I've also witnessed

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.330
how Uncle Gu completed his missions.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.250
I also saw firsthand
how Bai Ye operates.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.420
So I know

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.250
when the Communists take on a task,

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.700
they never rest until it's done.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.380
But Ding Yi,

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.180
things are different for you now.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.770
You have a wife
and you're about to get married.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.420
It doesn't have to be you.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.570
There's a radio in my study.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.940
I can report to your organization.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.700
Let me handle this task for you.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.700
I've been waiting for this day.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.180
I'll seek instructions from leadership.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.380
Looking forward to having you on board.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.660
Comrade Gu Yangshan.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.120
[Lead From the Front]

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.290
What are you doing?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.090
You guys...

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.180
Don't move!
We're searching for a fugitive.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.700
Officer, you've got the wrong person.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.700
You've got the wrong person.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.250
Everyone, turn around.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.730
Sir, we're with the Shanghai BIS.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.180
You two look just like fugitives to me.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.570
You...

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.860
Grab them.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.530
Officer, you've got the wrong people.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.250
It's a misunderstanding.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.730
Hurry, hurry.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.940
Move it, quick.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.330
Shixian.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.980
See you in the new world.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.490
See you there.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.090
Go.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.420
When you get to Yan'an,

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.940
we have to retake that group photo.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.980
Alright, wait for me in Yan'an.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.620
I also want to see
what the new world looks like.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.570
Come on.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.700
Take care.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.570
Comrade Gu Yangshan.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.380
Comrade Xiao.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.250
We've been waiting a long time for you.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.290
Finally, we meet in person.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.490
Nothing here, nothing there.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.420
All you say is there's nothing!

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.460
What else can you even say?

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.940
Sorry.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:05.660
So many people.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.140
You couldn't even catch a shadow.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.900
Did the Communists grow wings
and fly away or what?

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.980
No way.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.420
I know how they operate.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.090
Yesterday,

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.530
they must've been inside
the Gu Residence.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.730
What happened to your forehead?

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.180
Oh, that?

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.620
We were on plainclothes duty yesterday.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.420
Ran into Garrison Command
catching a fugitive.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.700
It was just a misunderstanding.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.730
I'm afraid it isn't a misunderstanding.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.860
Right now, the Elimination Committee

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.180
is using the banner
of rooting out traitors

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.620
to eliminate
our party's underground forces

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.700
from the War of
Resistance Against Japan.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.420
Comrade Xiao,
is there anything else I can do?

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.570
No need, really.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.180
We owe you a lot already.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.900
Commissioner Luo from the Committee

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.180
has been running around
for over half a month

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.770
but he still hasn't caught our comrades.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.460
And his chances are running out.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.860
Any results
from the Chongqing Negotiations?

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.420
We've been pushing hard for progress.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.860
The call for peace is louder than ever.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.940
Chairman Chiang
can't withstand the pressure,

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.180
so he's starting to make concessions.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.530
I think

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.980
within the next couple of days,

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.380
we'll know the outcome.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.620
That's great.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.940
During the war, when I was in Chongqing,

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.700
every time the frontline won a battle,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.770
people would set off firecrackers.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.330
But when the frontline lost,

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.250
white banners
would hang over the streets.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.900
That was how the people shared
the nation's joy and sorrow.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.940
After the war ended, I kept worrying,

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.220
if one day we ended up in a civil war,

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.380
with fathers and sons
turning on each other

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.700
and brothers fighting with blades,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.220
how would they know when to feel happy,

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.330
for whom to set off firecrackers,

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.730
or for whom to hang white banners?

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:46.700
I think,

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.570
you already know the answer.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.940
Comrade Xiao.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.250
About my party membership application...

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.420
Comrade Gu Yangshan,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.180
I'm officially informing you,

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:02.220
your application to join the Party

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.940
has been officially

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.090
approved by the Organization.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.860
Starting today

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.380
you are now a full-fledged

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.140
probationary member
of the Communist Party of China.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.140
Comrade.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.380
I've been waiting for this day

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.900
for far too long.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.140
Comrade Xiao, then I...

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.770
When will I get to see Yan'an?

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.980
The Organization
has decided that you use

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.490
your father's trip to the UK
for treatment

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.090
as a chance to leave Shanghai at once.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.980
On your return,
our comrades will meet you

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.090
and you'll head straight to Yan'an

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:47.380
to receive organizational training.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.900
You'll handle bigger tasks
in the future.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.940
Good.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.860
I understand, Director Dai.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.980
I'll take care of it.
You can count on me.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.090
Chief, I've already confirmed it.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.420
The Garrison Command

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.860
lost a prison transport truck.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.420
The newly appointed Deputy Inspector Liu

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.700
of the Songhu Garrison Command

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.730
is an old associate of the Gu family.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.730
I'm one hundred percent sure

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.700
he let those Communist members go.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.700
Mr. Dai just gave instructions.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.700
Things have been settled in Chongqing.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.380
And the Shanghai BIS has to halt

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.700
all actions against the Communists.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.700
So quit running around over this.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.460
What's going on?

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:44.860
No, that's not it.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:47.660
I just don't get it.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.250
What's the real grudge
between you and Yangshan?

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.620
You've searched, investigated,

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.860
and even smashed the place up.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.210
But you found no members

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.420
of the Communist Party in his place.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:02.290
What more do you want?

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.860
Sometimes you should stop
while you're ahead.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.050
But the Gu family lives off
the Party-State's payroll,

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.290
taking every advantage they can from it,

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.940
yet always working against it in secret,

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.860
even shielding the Communists.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.290
A traitor to the country like that,

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.940
if we don't take him out now,
when will we?

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.700
Deputy Chief Luo,
you're really stubborn.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.220
He's not with the Communist Party.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.250
Let's say he is for a moment,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.980
what can you actually do to him?

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.980
I...

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.290
You can't just throw him in prison

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.730
and make him a cellmate
with General Ye Ting.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.570
What, have the General
write another prison song?

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.700
"Why lock every door in and out?

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.490
And yet leave everything wide open?"

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:45.570
Aren't you just handing the CPC
free promotion material?

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.570
As for his situation,

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.290
Mr. Dai knows it inside out.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.980
His father, Gu Zhengze,

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.180
along with Commander Chen Shaokuan,

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.620
submitted a resignation together.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.730
When the Chairman got the letter,

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.010
he only said three words.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.050
"What the heck."

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.290
Right then, Mr. Dai had it figured out.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.460
This guy was a hot potato.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.330
We can't keep him nor throw him away.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.570
So tomorrow, he'll be sent to Nanjing

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.860
as the Deputy Director
of the new Cipher Bureau.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.730
He's put on research work only

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.330
and is kept out of public view.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:38.810
So just relax.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.490
Relax?

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.620
He's becoming Deputy Director.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.460
That's a promotion
instead of a demotion.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.330
And he even colluded with Inspector Liu

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.010
and exposed the warehouse photos

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:50.980
of our Seized Asset
Disposal Committee.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.010
And we're just letting it slide?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.730
Mr. Dai just mentioned on the phone,

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.330
that some people in Shanghai
are making victory money.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.420
And they've taken it way too far.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.490
They must be punished severely.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.530
So, what exactly did he find out?

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.770
The Meng family's residence.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.050
Did you transfer it to Secretary Mao?

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.460
All the paperwork is done.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.330
How did it all get processed so fast?

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.050
Chief Cao,
why does serving the Party-State

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.940
have to be so hard?

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.380
Taking the Meng Residence

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.330
was entirely my decision.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.660
Deputy Director Mao
knew nothing about it.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.420
I, Luo Han, am willing to resign

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.290
and take responsibility for it.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.730
I'm stepping away
from the Traitor Elimination Work.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.330
It didn't have to come to this.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.500
Deputy Director Mao means to say,

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.020
next month, our bureau is holding

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.770
a War Medal Award Ceremony.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:25.220
You don't need to take part.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.980
Just make an appearance.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.260
It's enough to give the team
an explanation.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.940
Just keep doing what you usually do.

on my behalf.

my father's not feeling well.

I need to take him
to the UK for treatment.

You've always been a devoted son.

Old Commander Gu's health

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.020
is something
the Chairman's been concerned about.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:14.290
He's assigned people to accompany him.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.370
So you can rest easy.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:17.610

Even experts from the US were amazed.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:50.810
With your talent,

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.940

Yet breaking it apart

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.860
only took one man in power

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.900

In June 1946,

the Kuomintang openly tore up
the Double Tenth Agreement,

launching a full-scale civil war.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.820

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.090
we've spent more time apart
than together.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.090
Yesterday at the Command,
I ran into Uncle Wu.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.940
He said,

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.900
everyone from the troupe is in Shanghai

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:17.300
and they can all be reached.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:19.500
When the day of liberation comes,

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.090
we'll marry at last,

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:23.090
invite all our old friends,

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.090
and have them witness it together.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.090
What do you think?

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.250
It's already midnight now.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.690
The courier is about to rest,

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.460
so I have to write this in a hurry,

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:45.530
just to send you my thoughts from afar.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.090
So much to say, yet words fall short.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.250
I'll kiss you a thousand times.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.860
Ms. Xian, your smile makes you
even lovelier.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:41.730
That mysterious radio inside Shanghai

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:42.530
is transmitting again.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.900
It's that same radio again.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.130
Comrade Ding Yi.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.210
Xu.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.460
Comrade Ding Yi.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.020
What happened?

00:38:59.040 --> 00:38:59.820
Something's gone wrong at the frontline?

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:02.210
Leader Xian and the others
are doing well.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.570
Lately, they have run into

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.050
some trouble with cipher work.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.690
They're gathering intel

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.250
for the Liberation of Shanghai.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:10.730
Recently, they discovered

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.380
a new radio operating in Shanghai.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.050
The radio's cipher is very unusual.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.050
It's extremely hard to crack.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.570
Leader Xian had the messages sent back,

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.650
so you could take a look.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.900
The Joseph Lee cipher.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.130
Why are you so determined to drop

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.420
the Joseph Lee cipher?

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.530
The ciphers we used before...

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.050
We designed them ourselves

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:10.570
and the Communists cracked every one.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.380
Can you even call that a cipher?

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.570
It's basically brain-teaser riddles.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:17.090
No, no.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.650
It doesn't even qualify as that.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.730
It's more like…

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:22.050
"What is the end

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.250
of everything?

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.650
Letter G."

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.900
Isn't that child's play?

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.500
And their CPC codebreakers

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.900
listen in on our channel every day,

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.130
like it's a holiday for them.

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.530
All that's left is for each of us

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.500
to hand them a bowl of sweet dumplings.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.050
But it shouldn't have

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.050
come to using Joseph Lee cipher again.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.050
That's a cipher we'd already retired.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.900
The scorched earth tactic
is so critical.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.730
How can we use
an abandoned cipher for that?

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.090
That cipher

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.530
was even praised by the US.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:52.690
It's a top-tier cipher.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.420
Ever since Gu Yangshan cracked it,

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.420
Director Mao has wanted to bring it back
if possible.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.500
It's working perfectly fine now,

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.050
so why throw it away?

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.130
Chief,

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.130
it works on a one-time pad rule.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:12.570
I know.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.650
If a new cipher officer can't grasp it,

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.250
it's easy to make mistakes.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:17.900
Unless Gu Yangshan comes back.

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.530
Nanjing Cipher Bureau

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.900
was shut down last month?

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.420
Where did Gu Yangshan go?

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.210
Out of respect for his late father,

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.090
Director Mao gave him a ticket
to China Taiwan.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.650
But he turned it down.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:50.650
He said he wanted to serve at Shanghai.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.090
So?

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.650
You agreed?

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.730
He's with the Communist Party, Chief!

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:07.730
Yangshan has been
in Nanjing for 4 years.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:11.020
He stayed out of sight, living clean.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.900
Why do you still think he's a Communist?

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.780
And about that Ding Yi matter.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.500
It's been almost ten years.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.130
I can barely even remember...

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.130
Yeah, almost ten years.

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:27.020
But I still believe just this one thing.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.610
You don't believe me at all, do you?

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:31.570
I...

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.570
I understand, Chief Cao.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:43.090
Developing a new cipher
takes time and effort

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.730
and you don't have the patience.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.420
Whether the scorched earth tactic works,

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.340
you don't really care.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:53.090
You just want it done
and reported upward

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:54.650
and head to China Taiwan
as soon as possible, right?

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:56.730
Deputy Chief Luo,

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.940
listen to my advice.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.420
I don't say this to anyone else.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.570
If you're leaving, do it early.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.780
The Communist Forces have stationed

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.610
a million troops
along the Yangtze River.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:13.170
A million troops.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.420
Do you know what that means?

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.650
With a few trucks of lousy explosives,

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.380
we can't turn the tide.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.020
Even if we can't,
I won't let them have it easy.

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.940
Aren't they all about looking good?

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.020
Talking about winning the city.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.570
Both for military and political gain.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.420
I just can't stand the way they act.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.170
Always trying to have it both ways.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.570
If they're so eager to get in,

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:39.020
let's leave them an empty,
lifeless city.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.570
Come in.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:50.730
Who are you?

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:51.730
Mr. Cao,

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.090
it's me.
