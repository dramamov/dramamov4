00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.040
Go!

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.240
Go!

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.960
Keep up.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.280
Zhou Mu.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.840
Stop fighting!

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.800
Go!

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.560
Go!

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.880
Chase them!

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.400
Go!

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.400
Stop!

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.600
Get out of the way!

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.720
Mu.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.920
Uncle Gao.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200
Run! Why don't you run?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.920
Mr Chen.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.760
What's going on?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.480
Director Zhou. Mr. Gao.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.520
Excuse me.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.000
I have something to do with them.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.360
Something to do with them?

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.800
Mr. Chen.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.240
It seems that you and my godson

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.880
between you and my godson.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.080
So you're Mr. Gao's godson.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.160
Since Mr. Gao is here,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.880
everything will be fine.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.720
It's okay. Let's go.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.960
Zhou Mu.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.440
You've grown up.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.360
I know

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.440
why you don't want to go to Nanjing.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.640
No.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.840
Take care.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.160
Thank you.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.440
Remember to give me your ID.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.920
Jia Jia, let's go.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.000
Do you think

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.280
you feel very accomplished?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.120
What do you mean?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.760
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.079
You ruined my plan.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.720
You're not good enough and you're good at it.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.080
You...

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.280
Look what you're doing.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.920
I...

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.360
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.760
You're alone today.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.480
to work overtime.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.040
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.079
You can't do such a small thing well.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.320
I really don't know

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.240
What are you doing here?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.560
Lu Jin-kyung, how many times have I told you?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.600
Do what you can. Get lost if you can't.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.680
There are many people to replace you.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.520
Lu Jinjing, people like you

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.320
in Shanghai.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.520
Who are you to get mad at me?

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.680
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.200
I asked you to come

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.560
to solve my problem.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.519
not to trouble me.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.160
It seems that Zhou Mu didn't find anything.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.480
I knew the clue was too secretive.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.280
He'll follow the list.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.880
Isn't that the girl who rejected you?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.440
Jin-kyung.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.920
Your friend

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.120
seems to need help.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.280
Find a chance to help her.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.200
What are you doing?

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.760
Nothing, I'm just looking.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.880
Is the sun out at night?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.440
When did Scarlett become so kind?

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.000
Drive quickly.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.280
Okay.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.720
Mr. Song.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.880
Have you received the receipt from the court?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.760
You girls broke my head.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.200
You must give me an explanation.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.600
Otherwise,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.920
the consequences are up to you.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.080
Made 0837.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.280
Don't worry.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.960
I will

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.440
give you a perfect explanation.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.920
Lu Jinjing

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.280
He ruined my plan.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.720
I must be out of my mind.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.360
Sir, I'm sorry.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.480
Let me clean the table.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.040
Thank you.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.800
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.440
Come here.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.680
Director

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.520
I'm sorry.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.560
Please give me another chance.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.720
I will make up for my mistakes at work.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.840
Jin-kyung.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.560
I usually like you.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.400
Really?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.520
But you let our old customer

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.840
of our old customers.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.120
You’re ruining our company.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.840
If our company

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.200
if we don’t do anything,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.120
what should I tell them?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.400
I don't care about other things.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.800
In the future,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.720
we have to work with them in depth.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.320
About this,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.680
Think about it.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.800
He wants to rape me.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.440
Don't talk nonsense.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.440
It's a matter of mutual love.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.080
Why are you being so harsh?

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.680
Besides, everyone saw it.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.320
you were drunk.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.680
And Mr. Chen

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.440
helped you

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.280
and take care of you.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.000
Go to Mr. Chen's house

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.920
to Mr. Chen.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.640
and finish what you should do.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.040
This thing

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.320
will be over.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.880
Absolutely impossible.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.240
Then why are you here?

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.040
From now on,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.559
you're fired.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.559
Fired?

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.000
You're fired.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.320
It's like...

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.240
to frame Mr. Chen?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.360
After it was exposed,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.280
he even bit Mr Chen instead.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.440
Now,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.840
doesn't work with us anymore.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.120
Besides,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.240
they sue you for intentional assault.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.480
We didn't ask you to compensate.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.120
because we didn't ask you to compensate.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.360
Nonsense!

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.600
I'm talking nonsense.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.960
What can you do to me?

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.760
Xu Jia Jia.
