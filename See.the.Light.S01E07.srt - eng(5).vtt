WEBVTT

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.400
I'm talking nonsense.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.800
What are you going to do to me?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.400
Xu Jia Jia.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.840
Come here.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.080
Director, you want to see me?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.200
How about this?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.960
You

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.040
tell her what happened yesterday.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.080
Otherwise,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.080
some employees

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.520
are not balanced.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.600
He's not satisfied with our decision.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.600
At the banquet yesterday,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.520
Mr. Chen and Mr. Niu were discussing about the investment.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.320
Jinjing had a few more drinks

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.039
but he didn't let go of Mr. Chen.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.080
In order to be safe,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.039
in order to be safe.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.680
Xu Jia Jia, what are you talking about?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.520
Jinjing.

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.800
Since it has happened,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.320
stop being unreasonable.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.039
We saw it.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.400
When I sent Mr. Niu back to his room,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.080
Jinjing didn't let go of Mr. Chen.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.560
Mr. Chen refused.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.440
Jinjing hurt Mr. Chen.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.320
How could you say that?

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.200
I saved you

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
saved you from Mr. Niu's room.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.000
Nonsense!

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.600
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.000
I know you're awake now.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.480
It's ugly.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.480
But I'm telling the truth.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.080
I may be weak,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.920
I won't allow anyone

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.920
to slander me.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.720
Xu Jia Jia.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.640
Why didn't you tell the truth

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.440
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.360
How dare you mention yesterday?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.920
Anyway,

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.520
I saved you for real, right?

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.960
You saved me.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.720
I saved you.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.160
If I hadn't saved you in time,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.920
Mr. Chen wouldn't be the only one

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.480
who's looking for trouble.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.000
Why?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.720
Why did I save you

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.800
instead of saving you?

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.000
Jin-kyung.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.160
This is life.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.520
Can you let it go?

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.320
Because of my poor background,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.200
because of my poor background.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.680
Low position, young

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.920
or because I'm a girl,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.360
just because I'm a girl?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.640
as a gift?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.400
Being treated as a gift

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.680
it means you are still qualified to be a gift.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.560
Look at our office.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560
in our office.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.080
You still can't do it?

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.840
No.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.720
It's not like that.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.760
It's a new society now.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.160
There are many

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.760
female scientists, female businessmen and female doctors

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.040
They achieved it with their own efforts.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.920
As women,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.000
I shouldn't look down on women.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.040
and look at women in the past.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.520
Then ask yourself.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.159
Are there many women like this?

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.960
Do you think I want to do this?

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.320
I advise you to be realistic.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.600
I'm also from a small county.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.520
I want to survive here.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.200
It's pretty.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.840
It's just a kind of suffering

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.640
and sadness.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.120
Mr. Niu

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.360
is older than my dad.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.920
But even so,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.200
we can live with dignity.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.080
Can't we?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.560
Let's be fair and square.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.720
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.200
You've been here for years.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.320
Have you become a manager?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.680
Did you become a manager?

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.640
Can you make a living?

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.159
This world

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.040
is not as simple as you think.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.440
To keep my job,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.720
I have to do something.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.600
Look at me.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.880
I'm getting higher and higher.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.840
And you

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.560
lost your job.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.040
But...

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200
You know what? You know what?

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.520
You're blocking my way. You're blocking my way.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.200
If you get in my way again,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.320
don't blame me for being rude.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.040
I almost raped you.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.000
Almost? That means you failed.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.240
That means nothing happened.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.000
He did it.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.040
He did it.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.480
Then tell me, almost.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.680
No, he tried to rape me.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.320
I'm a victim.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.320
I'm here to report a case.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.680
Why are you picking on me?

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.560
Cheap.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.160
Is there a witness?

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.920
My colleagues saw it.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.880
But they didn't admit it.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.040
I told you last time.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.880
we need evidence to call the police.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.000
You said you were right.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.040
He said he was right.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.080
Everyone says so.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.280
Then why do we need the police?

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.120
Your colleague saw it,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.080
but she doesn't want to help you.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.680
Shouldn't you think about

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.000
if it's your problem.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.040
I...

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.560
Anything else?

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.480
Just leave if there's nothing else.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.880
Don't delay my work.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.520
What's going on?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.600
What did that girl report?

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.920
It's nothing.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.120
Who is it?

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.559
Hello, landlord.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.080
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.559
Little girl.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.760
I have something to tell you inside.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.200
Come in.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.720
Miss, I'm sorry.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.880
We won't rent this house anymore.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.280
This is...

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.240
The rest of the rent.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.360
You should pack up and move out today.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.520
Why?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.920
You don't know

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.920
who you messed with outside.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.960
We are ordinary people.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.560
We can't offend them.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.040
But even if you want me to move out,

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.800
you have to give me time to find a place.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.760
There are houses everywhere.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.960
Just find one.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.680
We're also afraid of trouble.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.360
Please understand.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.960
I won't cause you any trouble.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.120
Can you give me a few more days?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360
Move out now.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.120
Uncle, please.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.120
Stop talking to her.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.200
I don't rent my house

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.760
to an indecent woman like her.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.560
Move out.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.040
See? I have no choice.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.800
You should've told me you're a businessman.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.840
If you told me earlier,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.160
I could have taken care of you.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.000
What are you talking about? Let's go.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.560
I told you to move, but you didn't.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.760
If you don't move, we'll help you.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.720
What are you doing?

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.840
My house is not rented to

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.000
an indecent woman.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.960
Move out.
