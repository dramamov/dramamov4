[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 30]

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.780
Biyun.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.980
Biyun!

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.780
Biyun!

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.260
Biyun!

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.610
Biyun!

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.380
Biyun!

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.380
Biyun!

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.660
Biyun!

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.820
Lin Megumi strapped the bomb onto me

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.900
and made me bring it here.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.660
Sasaki's men discovered it,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.690
and a fight broke out.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.340
The Tonoji family fired the first shot.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.410
I've told you everything I know.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.340
We're currently investigating the scene.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.690
Please wait here

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.660
until we have results.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.570
Thanks.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.620
It's all good now.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.250
Joseph Lee's eyes can't see.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.580
By the way,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.250
at the hospital earlier,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.700
Grand Duke Tonoji suddenly woke up.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.100
Nobody saw that coming.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.580
My cover was blown.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.700
I didn't have the chance to talk to you.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.020
The only thought in my head was

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.410
that I had to keep you safe.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.250
So maybe I acted a bit rashly.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.250
Please don't be mad at me.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.340
In the hospital, you yelled at me

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.250
and told me to shut up.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.820
I was a little upset about it.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.990
But I also told you to shut up earlier.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.580
So now we're even.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.410
Also,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.700
as the two of us

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.970
walked from there to the well,

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.260
carrying the bomb together,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.620
I...

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.940
I rambled on with a stream of nonsense.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.530
Because I...

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.620
I honestly thought at that moment

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.580
I might not make it out alive.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.380
I'm afraid it will be too late
to say it.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.290
So I...

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.290
You...

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.410
Just pretend you didn't hear any of it.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.580
But I did hear it.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.260
When I was trapped in the hospital,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.530
I was pretty scared too.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.820
After you left,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.140
that room felt so quiet

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.260
like a grave.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.260
I pricked up my ears,

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.140
listening all the time,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.940
hoping

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.650
and longing to hear the sound
of the cane again.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.740
Yeah.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.940
That exact sound.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.290
I used to hate hearing it the most.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.580
Because every time it meant

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.940
we had to hide who we were
and face danger.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.380
But when I heard the sound fade away

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.140
and gradually disappear,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.820
I was terrified for the first time
in my life.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.410
I was scared of losing you.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:34.620
Ding Yi,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.070
it's not that I don't care.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.140
I can feel it all.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.340
Iâ€¦

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.860
Honestly, I've always felt

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.330
I...I'm not worthy of you.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.500
I am a very timid person.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.740
Yes, you are.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.530
But even so,

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.620
you've still done
so many amazing things.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.620
Hurry and change out my cipher

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.340
to prevent any leaks.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.930
I'm allergic to shrimp,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.990
but I still asked them
for a plate of shrimp.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.770
After eating it,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.650
I indeed broke out in a rash.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.770
I am now the Deputy Director
of the Cryptography Institute.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.980
You won't need to ask anyone else
for help anymore.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.980
I'm here with you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.460
Is it just about saving face?

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.740
What do you mean?

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.340
Biyun.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.530
Biyun...

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.340
Be careful.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.140
Is that you?

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.380
Yes, it's me.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.530
I'm here.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.620
Come on.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.140
Smell me.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.440
Smell me right now.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.380
Come on.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.220
Smell.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.410
Don't worry.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.620
This is the first official task

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.740
they've given me.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.770
I won't let them down.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.650
As for this Sasaki,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.930
I can't let him stay.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.530
Anyone under Sasaki's wing,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.410
I won't let a single one go!

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.500
I'm not leaving now.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.020
Please let me finish his mission.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.650
I want to become Bai Ye.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.690
Gu, Hongyu, and Bai Ye,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.620
their sacrifice was not in vain.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.260
I'll be just like them,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.620
giving my all without holding back,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.500
and risking everything to save others.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.260
Every time I see you, I wonder

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.860
how there could be someone so silly.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.930
You don't know anything.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.620
You can't do anything.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.980
You clearly had many chances to leave,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.810
yet you insisted on staying,

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.670
going down this path to the very end.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.650
When you left the hospital,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.860
what you said

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.770
showed you were braver than anyone.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.740
In the book of fate,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.380
our names are written side by side.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.260
At that time, I just wanted to prove

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.260
that until the day I die,
I am a good actor.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.620
Actually, I have always

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.690
regarded you as my guiding light.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.290
Like Romeo

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.020
to Juliet,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.460
I only wanted to be by your side.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.020
But at that time,

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.620
I overestimated love

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.260
and underestimated the revolution.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.860
Later, I realized

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.620
you're not like Juliet.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.860
To you, love

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.220
might just be a small flourish in life,

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.930
something extra to make life brighter.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.620
Even without love,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.620
you'd still be the bravest fighter.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.620
That's why I kept pushing myself,

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.140
trying to become someone like you.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.860
You made it happen.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.860
Although we are not qualified
to talk about love now,

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.380
we all have the right to yearn for it.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.500
This ring,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.140
I'll treasure it forever.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.140
It wasn't given to me by Joseph Lee.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.740
It was from Ding Yi.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.220
The shape of this ring

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.380
is called a Mobius strip.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.100
It has only one curved surface

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.860
that loops endlessly.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.860
No matter which direction they go,

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.860
they are on the same path

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.010
and will inevitably meet in the end.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.620
In the book of fate,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.020
our names are written side by side.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:55.980
Of course,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.620
on that very same line,

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.980
stand 400 million Chinese.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.500
Hello?

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.740
The last stronghold is confirmed too.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.020
Mr. Liang,

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.530
your intel accuracy...

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.660
You're truly impressive.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.460
Since this is my show of loyalty,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.810
I need to do it clean and proper.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.330
I can't put you in a tough spot.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.260
I've given you the intel,

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.180
and it's been checked.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.460
We've been at this all night.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.740
Now you should tell me
what time the ship departs.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.530
See Mr. Liang onto the ship.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.330
Wait.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.850
What's that supposed to mean?

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.180
Mr. Liang,

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.180
don't blame me for playing it this way.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.220
If you must blame someone,
blame yourself.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.530
Such a large flour mill,

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.740
with dozens of people,

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.290
just disappeared like that.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.530
In life, you have to keep a backup plan.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.810
If I hadn't left myself a way out,

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.530
would you be where you are today?

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.290
Say whatever you want.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.740
Anyway,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.910
it is imperative for me

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.930
to eliminate traitors
and save the nation.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.440
Eliminate traitors?

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:26.740
If that's how you put it,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.660
then we really need to have a long talk.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:30.980
Chief Cao,

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.540
where's that Late-Ming Heavenly Maiden
Scattering Blossoms?

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.180
After the Shanghai Bureau was bombed,

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.700
this painting turned up

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.530
at Vice Chairman Zhou's home
in the Nanjing Puppet Government.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.490
What a coincidence.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.460
The person who happened to help you
deliver it to the Zhou residence

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.980
is an old acquaintance of mine.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.660
I've seen that painting myself.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.700
The maiden in it
had the most alluring eyes.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.330
You step outside for a minute.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.490
That painting had been missing
for a long time.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.050
You have news about it?

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.250
Chief Cao,

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.730
if I end up dying here today,

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.810
yes,

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.940
I can keep my mouth shut,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.250
but whether my family

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.180
can keep this secret for you,

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.380
I am not sure.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.900
Sasaki's radio and messages

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.980
are enough to prove
he wanted the Tonoji family dead.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.420
And last night, Lin Megumi's actions

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.800
were also defined by the military

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.790
as undermining the unity
within the Imperial Army.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.530
Now both groups are subject
to the investigation.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.220
All their operations in China
will be shut down.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.980
So the New Government's cipher work,

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:33.900
Mr. Lee,

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.620
can only rely on you now.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.620
This is

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.250
the confidential radio data
managed by Sasaki.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.490
Please handle the handover
as soon as possible.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.400
[Confidential Document]

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:11.790
How about this?

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.900
This list of strongholds

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.050
can be considered my toll for passage.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.860
What I have in my hands
is far more than just this.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.420
Many people in the Wang Government

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.860
have a warehouse in China Hong Kong,

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.770
hiding tons of gold and antiques.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.990
I'm the only one who knows the location.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.220
Do you even dare to tell me
the location of the warehouse?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.810
As long as I can safely
reach Chongqing,

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.490
we'll sign it together,

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.460
and the credit will belong
to both of us.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.050
Such a big favor,

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.620
just for two ship tickets?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.460
Of course,

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.050
I also need you

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.900
to give me a Letter of Appointment,

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.490
proving that I'm not a traitor,

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:09.180
but that you sent me
to infiltrate the Japanese organization.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.180
Which comrade needs
to blow up Shanghai Bureau

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.090
sacrificing a key liaison point?

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.700
Mr. Liang, I'd love to help you,

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.980
but your story has holes.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.330
Do you think it has holes,

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.620
or does someone else think so?

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.050
We must give the comrades
an explanation.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.220
This is Director Dai's decision. I...

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.770
Dare not overstep.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.090
So what kind of explanation do you need?

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:26.900
Finally,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.010
all obstacles have been cleared away.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.520
What's wrong?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.050
There's one last thing.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:24:59.730
Who is it?

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.220
It's me.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.980
Liang, you're finally back.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.400
Those people at the door

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.440
look so creepy and strange.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.980
I was so scared alone.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.700
Close the door.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.190
Did you get the ship tickets?

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.900
Yes, tomorrow afternoon.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.570
Thank goodness.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.040
Hurry up and pack your things.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.860
Remember to bring my medicine.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.900
It's all ready.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.460
Not sure if the doctors
in Chongqing are good.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.090
But I've prepared anyway.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.250
If it really doesn't work out,
I'll just sell it

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:42.730
to help out with the bills.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.330
If one day we can really move
to China Hong Kong,

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.620
that would be amazing.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.490
It's pretty close to Shunde.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.900
My whole family lives there.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.630
We wouldn't have to worry
about anything.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.530
People always say

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.380
China Hong Kong is warm all year round.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.050
Your leg will get much better
over there.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.980
There's a place called Queen's Road.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.490
They say all the fancy stuff
is on Queen's Road.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.380
Rich folks live in Mid-Levels.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.490
In the Mid-Levels area,

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.980
if you open the window,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.220
you can see Victoria Harbour
right there.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.550
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.700
When we're settled,

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.700
maybe we could have a kid.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.250
Before, we kept saying, let's wait.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.090
We wanted to give our child
a better life.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.520
I've finally understood something.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.940
As long as we're both safe and sound,

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.980
that's the best life we could ask for.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.700
Don't you agree?

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:15.700
Yin,

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.980
you've been through so much
all these years.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.250
Good times are just around the corner.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.220
Very soon.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.460
Liang,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.140
we've spent half our lives
scheming against others.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:21.770
This time,

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.290
you even included me in your schemes.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.770
You little wretch!

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.250
Liang,

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.490
people make their small plans,

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.730
but Heaven

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.700
has the ultimate plan.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:01.980
Let it...

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.670
They say a real man must be ruthless.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.980
Mr. Liang,

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.530
you really have guts.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.980
So what kind of explanation do you need?

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.730
Back then in Japan, the one
who helped you rise up

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:23.700
is

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.980
Mrs. Liang.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.140
Ye Yin sheltered
under the Japanese invaders,

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.280
and betrayed the central command.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.190
Despite repeated efforts

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:52.980
to dissuade her,

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.790
she launched a surprise attack
on the Shanghai Bureau.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.980
Dozens of our comrades died
in the flames.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.050
This crime is beyond forgiveness.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.050
Would this explanation satisfy you?

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.730
You seized the stronghold
in the Japanese Concession

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.420
and avenged our brothers in Shanghai.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.460
Plus the gold from the warehouse
in China Hong Kong.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.440
That's three major achievements.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.940
Mr. Liang,

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.250
now I can see you off onto the ship.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.180
Thank you, Chief Cao.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.460
May I take my wife's body back
to Chongqing?

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.940
Sure, let's go.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.420
I didn't expect

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.180
so many things to happen in one night.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.940
Sorry I didn't help you.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.420
But I was about to look for you too.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.900
Now Sasaki is dead,

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.720
and Liang Jingyuan has gone missing.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.530
The Sword Thrust Operation

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.530
will be the sole intel channel

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.770
within the New Government.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.140
What a pity.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.330
We can't share it.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.700
That's quite a bold move.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.690
Are you in such a hurry
to drive me away?

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.580
Luo Han's about to board the ship
back to Chongqing.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.940
Once he reports

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.280
your and Xian Biyun's identities

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.530
to my superiors,

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.730
Chongqing will spare no effort

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.940
to take both your lives.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.620
And these are

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.460
ship tickets to China Hong Kong.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.860
Now Grand Duke Tonoji is dead.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.560
I've joined the Pacification Committee.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.530
I no longer need Joseph Lee.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.730
To the public, I will say

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.460
that Joseph Lee can no longer
continue working

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.940
due to the worsening of his tumor.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.080
Once you get to China Hong Kong,

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.280
decide for yourself where to go next.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.260
Do you think

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.960
that after all this,

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.690
death can still threaten me?

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.880
By the way,

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.210
about your mother,

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.090
I'm sorry.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:28.820
Tastes great.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.690
Did you make this sauce?

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:35.980
Your mother made this.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.460
This is from Baimahu.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:44.050
Actually, I made that sauce myself.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.130
Your mother is safe in Baimahu.

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.300
My people are just
protecting her discreetly.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.150
They haven't disturbed her at all.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.980
When you get to China Hong Kong,

00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:54.750
I'll make sure she gets there too.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:56.210
Really?

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.340
Do you think threatening me

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.900
using my mother repeatedly

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.740
will still work on me?

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:07.950
Do you think I'd leave her in Baimahu?

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.860
You're right.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.530
I forgot

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.270
you're an organized person now,
aren't you?

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.460
Alright then.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.650
From now on, let's stay out
of each other's way.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.820
You work at the Cryptography Institute,

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.770
and I work
at the Pacification Committee.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.820
Let's not interfere with each other.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.820
The noodles are here.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.780
Noodles for you two.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:04.460
Tastes great. Great!

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.900
Tastes just like two years ago.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.900
Hasn't changed a bit.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.050
Go on, try it.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.780
This is really interesting.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.940
I remember two years ago,

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.780
the two of us

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.210
sat in this very spot.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.610
Back then you told me to stay.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.740
But today you're pushing me to leave.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.530
But back then,

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.090
you were full of fire,

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:46.570
more spirited than now.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:48.740
Yeah.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.570
We still fought side by side then.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.170
And that day,

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:02.010
I actually felt guilty towards you.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.420
You told me
you had three great strengths.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.530
Sharp eye, good at imitation
and a great memory.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.520
Turns out you weren't lying.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.460
Eat some more.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.460
It's a long way back to Chongqing.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.460
Sir, the soup's way too salty.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.980
General Yasui asked me

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.090
what exactly was going on
with the report letter

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.050
you wrote earlier.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.460
Sorry, I told him the truth.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.170
You colluded with Liang Jingyuan

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:55.630
and tried to set me up on purpose.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.530
Those four people you see now

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.980
are all under General Yasui.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.940
They're about to take you back
for questioning.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.130
Aren't you afraid I might disclose

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.300
both your identity and that
of Xian Biyun to him?

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.980
I met Charlie back in the UK.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.130
He insisted on becoming my assistant.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.980
And I have no idea

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.420
who he is

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:28.820
or what he has done.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.610
Do you think General Yasui

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:37.650
would believe Charlie

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:39.490
or would believe

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.740
the only survivor of the Tonoji family,

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.210
Joseph Lee?

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.490
Don't forget

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.260
I'm the one who made you Joseph Lee.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.900
Secretary Gu, please come with us.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:09.960
It's just an investigation, right?

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:10.690
No problem.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.690
I will conduct it thoroughly.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.380
Let's go.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:18.980
Hold on a second.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.530
Charlie,

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.490
tell them everything.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.460
Are you out of your mind?

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.420
You were right just now.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.490
It's just an investigation.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.460
Not scary at all.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.340
But things are different now.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.660
You killed four Japanese
Military Police

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.090
with the gun in your hand.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:07.210
The Japanese,

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.300
as you well know,

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.730
will come and execute you on the spot.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.100
These people here

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.380
are all working for Yasui.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.630
As soon as your gun is fired,

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.040
the backup troops they have arranged

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:17.120
will immediately rush over.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.300
Two minutes at the most.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.940
So now you have two minutes

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:21.730
to escape.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.420
Take me hostage.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.610
At the mouth of the alley,

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.940
I've got a car ready for you.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.210
The key is inside.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.090
What happened between us in the street

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.570
will reach Chongqing in no time.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.020
You cut ties with the communists.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:36.820
Only then,

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.610
can you protect all the glory
of the Gu Family.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.570
This is your plan, huh?

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.340
You have only 90 seconds left.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.300
Think it through now.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.420
Leaving now

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.020
is your only way to survive.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.020
Interesting.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.980
I once tricked you using your mother.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.420
Now you've dragged my father into it.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.980
This isn't a scheme.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.460
It's the truth.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.690
And it's what you taught me before.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:20.090
Feelings should always come
after stance.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.050
Our stances

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.020
are no longer the same.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:28.820
Fine.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.250
Then we'll just wait quietly for them.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.860
Stay back.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:12.170
Or I'll hurt him.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.250
I said, stay back!

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.820
Don't shoot. Don't hurt Mr. Lee.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.500
Take care.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.210
Mr. Lee!

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.340
Are you alright?

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.170
Go after him, hurry!

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.610
Check over that way.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.210
Got it.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.080
â™ªFlames dancing aloneâ™ª

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:54.770
â™ªBroken candle waxâ™ª

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.660
â™ªHolding onto the warmthâ™ª

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.220
â™ªEyes tinted red with lightâ™ª

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.510
â™ªFlickering dimnessâ™ª

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:04.200
â™ªA lonely little lampâ™ª

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.220
â™ªFlowers cradle morning dewâ™ª

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:09.360
â™ªCracked skinâ™ª

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.100
â™ªTurns back into earthâ™ª

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.490
â™ªWhen the sun risesâ™ª

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:16.030
â™ªThat very first lightâ™ª

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:18.100
â™ªWill dance for meâ™ª

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.590
â™ªHome lost in the mistâ™ª

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:23.520
â™ªNowhere to goâ™ª

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.430
â™ªAnd nowhere to retreatâ™ª

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.860
â™ªI swallowed the pain againâ™ª

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.970
â™ªA real life or a play?â™ª

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.850
â™ªIt's hard to tellâ™ª

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.140
â™ªWhere does the wind go?â™ª

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:38.150
â™ªWhose window does it shake?â™ª

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:39.980
â™ªIt whispers softlyâ™ª

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.290
â™ªIt rustles in my heartâ™ª

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:45.420
â™ªMaybe you or maybe meâ™ª

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.010
â™ªCaught in the sorrowâ™ª

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:50.280
â™ªSomeone keeps the watchâ™ª

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.210
â™ªOn the vast plainsâ™ª

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.650
â™ªTears gently fallâ™ª

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:01.310
â™ªCracked wounds linger onâ™ª

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.570
â™ªSomeone keeps the watchâ™ª

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:08.240
â™ªWandering in the shadowsâ™ª

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.120
â™ªNightfall closes inâ™ª

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.670
â™ªWhen we turn back, dawn appearsâ™ª

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.860
â™ªSomeone keeps the watchâ™ª

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:22.120
â™ªOn the vast plainsâ™ª

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.470
â™ªTears gently fallâ™ª

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.960
â™ªCracked wounds linger onâ™ª

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.350
â™ªSomeone keeps the watchâ™ª

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:37.000
â™ªWandering in the shadowsâ™ª

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:40.000
â™ªNightfall closes inâ™ª

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:44.240
â™ªWhen we turn back, dawn appearsâ™ª

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.860
â™ªNightfall closes inâ™ª

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:53.030
â™ªWhen we turn back, dawn appearsâ™ª
