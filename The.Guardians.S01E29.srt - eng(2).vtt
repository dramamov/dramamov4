[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 29]

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.540
Has the decoding result

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.460
of Sasaki's private radio come out?

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.540
Lock down top floor; Target the doctor.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.660
I'm truly sorry.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.380
The surgery dragged on for too long.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.460
The patient's brain vessels
were already too strained.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.660
We had to perform cranial surgery,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.450
but the Grand Duke
didn't make it through.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.940
What did you just say?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.940
If it had been Dr. Edward performing it,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.100
there might have been a chance.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.340
Please accept my condolences.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.130
Everyone, get out!

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.820
Sasaki must be taken down.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.540
Young Master.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.380
How's the Master doing?

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.820
Master is still
the same as always.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.820
Have you checked out the location yet?

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.660
Already checked.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.540
Yuyin Pavilion.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.780
Perfect.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.380
Forge records of Liang Jingyuan visiting

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.820
Yuyin Pavilion in the past six months.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.980
The military police
will investigate tomorrow.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.380
So we need to act fast.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.100
Here, these are
Liang Jingyuan's letters.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.540
They'll help you
copy his handwriting.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.820
Got it, young master.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.660
Wait.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.380
Take this money.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.220
Buy two ferry tickets to
China Hong Kong.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.660
Keep the rest for yourself.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.820
Thank you, young master.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.980
Didn't you want to get back at Sasaki?

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.940
I'll make it happen for you now.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.340
Once the job's done,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.100
I can spare your wife's life.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.700
Can we really trust this guy?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.340
Will he really go along with our plan?

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.340
What other choice does he have?

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.340
Either way,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.540
we can't let him go in alone.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.700
I'll escort him inside.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.700
When the moment comes,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.220
I'll make sure he fulfills

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.980
his promise to the Tonoji family.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.100
There's no turning back from this.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.700
Since the Shogunate Era,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.660
my ancestors have served your family.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.580
We've been your vassals for generations.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.780
It's my duty to sacrifice
for the Tonoji family.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.100
Miss Megumi,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.780
to avenge the Grand Duke is my honor.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.460
Please grant me this.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.700
Thank you.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.340
Everyone,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.220
tonight,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.460
we're walking into a war.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.140
The outcome of this war

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.900
is the pride and honor
of the Tonoji family.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.980
Now,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.580
the Sasaki family is coming to

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.100
take it all right out of your hands.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.580
Doesn't that make you angry?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.980
Yes!

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.900
Then stand with me, fight with me.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.700
Let's move!

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.020
In the book of fate,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.140
our names are written side by side.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.420
Did you handle Liang Jingyuan?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.500
Liang Jingyuan divulged
a list of secret agents

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.420
the Wang Government planted
inside the Public Concession.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.740
Cao Yuanzhong still needs to verify it.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.380
Once confirmed, he'll make his move.

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.180
You still trust Cao Yuanzhong?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.180
I don't.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.490
But to Cao Yuanzhong, Liang Jingyuan

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.100
is a sworn enemy.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.770
That's the first reason.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.010
And the second one.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.580
This is a huge win handed to him.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.940
Cao Yuanzhong won't pass this up.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.580
What's wrong with the radio?

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.460
The radio's just too big.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.820
Carrying it out like this

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.730
is way too conspicuous.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.940
It could easily draw unwanted attention.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.580
Hold on.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.700
This is the radio
for the Sword Thrust Operation.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.850
Where exactly are you taking it?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.300
Do you still want to carry out
that doomed plan?

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.220
You'll get yourself killed, Gu Yangshan.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.580
Luo Han, I didn't get a chance
to explain.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.770
Next, I'm going to fake evidence

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.770
that Liang Jingyuan
went to Yuyin Pavilion.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.890
So Sasaki will think
he's the one working with you.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.300
As long as Cao Yuanzhong takes him out

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.650
and cleans up the body.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.010
Then...

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.460
he'll be the BIS officer who rescues you

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.770
and the one who killed Sasaki's son.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.820
And no one would ever suspect me.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.180
I can keep carrying out the operation.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.820
And then?

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.580
Then you can stay here,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.610
and work with Ding Yi and the others.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.460
What?

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.730
You still don't get it?

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.010
The problem isn't Sasaki anymore,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.820
the Cryptography Institute
is crawling with red bandits.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.650
They dared snatch the codebook from me.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.340
That means we've completely fallen out.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.180
They'll never let you stay here again.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.580
Come back to Chongqing with me.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.700
I'm not going back to Chongqing.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.940
Until the Sword Thrust Operation
is done,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.890
I'm not going anywhere.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:10.770
No matter what's going on

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.770
at the Cryptography Institute,

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.610
I'm with the Pacification Committee now.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.060
I still have a chance.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.730
In that case,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.770
why am I the one who has to leave?

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.100
That's exactly what I want to ask you.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.100
Why do I have to be the one to go?

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.580
Luo Han.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.980
Since you came back from Yuyin Pavilion,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.610
you've been talking to me in an odd way.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.420
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:50.890
Alright.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.650
Here's the deal.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.650
Give me a little more time.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.420
I'll drive Ding Yi out of the picture.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.100
But let me tell you this,

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.580
the Sword Thrust Operation

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.820
must go on.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.100
If you insist on staying,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.220
I'll report it
when I get back to Chongqing.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.220
Secretary Mao will send someone
to deal with them.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.610
It won't affect your operation.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.460
My operation?

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.180
Is this my operation?

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.220
Stop using

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.300
your usual excuses to handle things

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.420
to persuade or brush me off.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.180
Collaborating with the Communists
is a severe crime.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.220
I must report it

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.700
to prevent it from blowing up later.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.820
Deputy Commander Gu will protect you,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.460
and I'll be the scapegoat.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.060
Gu Yangshan,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.940
don't think

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.300
I don't know why you're staying.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.460
It isn't to execute the operation.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.180
You want to work with
the Communist Party

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.220
on the Sword Thrust Operation.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.980
Say that again.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.460
I'm sorry.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.460
Sorry.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:06.820
Sit.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.580
I don't understand why.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.060
Why is it that...

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.490
At the start, everyone clearly

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.980
was walking the same path.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.940
But as we went on,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.220
one by one, we drifted apart.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.650
No, we didn't drift apart.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.580
We were never truly on the same path.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.770
I shouldn't have joined you
in that madness from the start.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.100
Because I'm not you.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.300
I can't afford to lose.

[Late Army Major,
Battalion Commander]

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.250
Please inform Major General Sasaki,

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.850
Joseph Lee of the Tonoji family

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.460
has come to pay his respects.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.730
Alright, please wait a moment.

[Great Lay Buddhist Lingyun
of the Chisho-in Cloister]

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.300
Why hasn't Liang Jingyuan

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.650
brought Luo Han
and Charlie Gu in?

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.130
Yes.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.770
I just called
the Military Police HQ.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.490
They said they left a while ago.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.010
Go find them quickly.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.420
Taro's running out of patience.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.650
Understood.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.010
Go now.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.890
Yes, sir.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.770
Report, Major General.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.610
Joseph Lee is here to pay his respects.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.890
Perfect timing.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.490
Miss Megumi.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.490
What?

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.060
You're going to die.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.980
Major General.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.850
The Tonoji family plans to kill you.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.220
Don't you care about your wife's life?

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.570
Get ready to move.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.570
Yes.

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:26.570
Mr. Lee.

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.250
What on earth is going on here?

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.250
Major General.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.460
Grand Duke Tonoji has passed away.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.900
Right now, everyone in the Tonoji family

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.460
believes that you caused his death.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.700
So they sent me to take revenge for him.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.180
But deep down, I know

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.940
this is all part of Lin Megumi's scheme.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.700
She wants me to die together with you.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.090
But I don't want to die.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.250
I want to make a deal with you.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.220
I was the one who killed the Grand Duke.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.660
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.900
You ruined my son's
Spirit Transfer Ritual.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.940
You startled his spirit,
leaving him with no peace.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.620
I can't let you walk out of here alive.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.980
What else do you want to trade with me?

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.460
We can talk now.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.380
A bomb.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.220
Everyone, stop!

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.090
Nobody move.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.460
There's an ambush outside.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.700
Step out and you're done for.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.980
Take them to the back hall.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.940
Take them to the back hall.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.050
Mr. Lee.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.700
What tricks
does your Tonoji family still have?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.180
I'm genuinely curious.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.730
Lin Megumi wants you dead

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.700
to avenge the Grand Duke.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.940
But she knows this place
is heavily guarded.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.460
A direct assault
from outside wouldn't work.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.620
So...

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.730
she threatened me with my wife's life,

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.460
forced me to strap on a bomb
to blow you up.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.180
Just now, this person...

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.900
The moment he pulls the fuse on me,

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.730
no one here will walk out alive.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.940
Once the people outside hear the blast,

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.940
they'll rush in
and wipe out the survivors.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.730
Why does Lin Megumi suspect me?

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.460
Major General,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.900
you have a private radio.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.140
A few days ago,
you sent a coded message.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.660
The content of that message was,

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.460
"Lock down top floor;
Target the doctor."

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.860
Am I right?

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.140
Now Dr. Edward has been poisoned

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.730
and can't operate on the Grand Duke,

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.220
which led to the Grand Duke's death.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.220
And Lin Megumi has already found

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.660
that private radio of yours.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.180
So,

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.250
as things stand,

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.250
Lin Megumi is convinced

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.180
that you're the one who did it.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.980
You can't deny it anymore.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.220
My men at the hospital
haven't made a move.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.180
This has nothing to do with me.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.220
But now even your radio operator

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.700
has been captured by Lin Megumi.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.250
If that operator reveals your name,

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.700
do you think

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.620
the leadership will still believe

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.620
the Duke's death is unrelated to you?

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.940
Mr. Lee,

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.090
let's hear your terms.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.900
My wife

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.700
is being held hostage
at the Army Hospital

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.460
by Lin Megumi.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.700
You need to notify your people right now

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.980
to rescue my wife.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.770
My wife knows

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.980
where Megumi is keeping

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.980
your radio operator.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.940
And she can help you
wipe out the evidence.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.700
You're the sworn son
of the Tonoji family,

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.460
yet you come here telling me this.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.980
How can I not be suspicious?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.460
That this is the Tonoji family

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.900
setting yet another trap for me.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.980
This is me showing my good faith.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.420
From this moment on,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.700
I, Joseph Lee, and the Tonoji family

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.620
are completely done with each other.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.220
Still no movement?

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.220
Not at all.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.570
Things are getting more interesting.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.460
Joseph Lee.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:36.260
My people will soon get your wife out.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.330
But right now,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.050
if you don't tell me everything

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.770
exactly as you know it,

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.770
I can still have her killed.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.260
Bring Xian Biyun here.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:50.770
Yes, sir.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.220
You,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.500
bring Xian Biyun here.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.570
Yes.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.500
Major General.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.940
There's no time left.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.330
Lin Megumi and the Tonoji family

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.500
are lying in wait outside.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.770
I've been in here for so long.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.180
With no explosion,

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.530
she's going to get suspicious.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.980
They'll storm in any minute.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.020
It'll lead to
a destructive fight with you.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.810
She sent you as a sacrificial pawn

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.020
because she's too afraid

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.020
to charge in and go down with me.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.740
You can keep talking without worry.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.530
Major General Sasaki

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:48.660
let me ask you

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.460
where our radio operator is being held.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.370
Lin Megumi said,

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.370
it was my son who poisoned Dr. Edward.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.290
That's right.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.260
Now she's still spreading it everywhere.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.420
The night before Dr. Edward fell ill,

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.700
she saw a man with a scar on his palm

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.050
dressed as a doctor,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.260
handing Dr. Edward a poisoned folder.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.740
That's ridiculous.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.420
Taro is a mathematician.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.660
He's never even killed a chicken,

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.260
let alone poisoned anyone.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.700
But with just that scar on the palm

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.530
and your secret telegram,

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.260
it's enough for her to accuse you

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.700
before the Japanese military leadership.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.740
As long as Taro is still alive,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.810
her lie falls apart instantly.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.420
How could the Tonoji family

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.460
be so foolish?

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.570
Major General,

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.220
you can't believe that Taro was killed

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.700
by an anti-Japanese operative, right?

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.740
Lin Megumi.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.420
Major General,

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.180
right now the Tonoji family members

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.220
are lying in wait outside.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:22.740
With your skills,

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.260
you could launch a surprise attack

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.220
and wipe them out completely.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.740
If the leadership asks later,

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.770
everyone here tonight

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.220
can testify for you

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.770
that it was them who struck first,

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.220
and you were only defending yourself.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.740
Miss Megumi, please show up.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.980
Miss Megumi, please show up.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.660
Miss Megumi, please show up.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.810
Miss Megumi.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.900
Miss Megumi.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.260
Miss Megumi.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:16.260
Should we go in now?

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.980
Hold on.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.020
It's a trap.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.180
A message just came from the hospital.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.290
Xian Biyun helped us find our radio

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.290
and the operator.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.770
But the operator already confessed.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.460
Lin Megumi got our transmission records.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.260
It's likely reported to the leadership.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.980
Tell him to deal with the traitor.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.500
Then bring Xian Biyun here.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.770
I have questions for her.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.020
Understood.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.180
Understood.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.940
What do you think, Major General?

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.180
I wasn't lying, was I?

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.290
I'll wait for her to show up.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.020
Let her explain herself.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.770
You want to confront Lin Megumi?

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:32.980
But she seems to be hiding something.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.660
She thinks it's just a trap in there.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.260
She's not coming in at all.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.740
What if I have a way

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.740
to get her inside?

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.900
How's that?

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.020
Hurry!

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.020
Hurry!

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.180
Hurry!

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.020
It's time.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.220
Go in with me!

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.980
Yes.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.420
It's a trap. Get out.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.180
Yes.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.220
Lin Megumi.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.500
So you really do want me dead.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.420
You framed me for plotting
against the Duke.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.420
I've informed General Yasui.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.740
He's on his way now.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.660
As long as you face the trial calmly

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:25.090
and tell everything truthfully,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.330
the Tonoji family can still survive.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.740
Otherwise, stirring up infighting

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.220
is enough to get your family wiped out.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.130
You need to think this through.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.900
Your son poisoned Dr. Edward.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:58.940
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.090
Is that what you call framing too?

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.050
And that con man?

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.180
You mean Joseph Lee?

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.940
He's an imposter.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.740
His real name is Ding Yi.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.260
He's a true anti-Japanese operative.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.530
He murdered Joseph Lee,

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.260
then took over his identity.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:24.700
Major General.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.090
Isn't that exactly what I just said?

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.850
She'll accuse me
of being an anti-Japanese operative.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.420
She might even claim I'm not Joseph Lee.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.740
If I guessed right,

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.740
next...

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.420
she'll say right away,

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.090
I'm just

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.370
an actress in my wife's troupe.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.460
She might even insult me,

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.460
claiming I'm not really blind.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.610
Major General,

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.460
she's completely lost it.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.850
This woman

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.660
is desperate
to inherit the Tonoji family.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.090
She'll say anything to get it.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:01.500
But Miss Megumi,

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:02.740
you should know,

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.260
I've worked with the Major General

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.700
for a full year.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.090
If I weren't Joseph Lee,

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.740
how would I know how to design a cipher?

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.130
How could I help the Major General solve

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.940
one tricky problem after another?

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.900
Are Dr. Miyamoto,

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.850
Lieutenant Colonel Takeda,
Liang Jingyuan,

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:24.130
and even Major General all fools?

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.610
Yes, they are.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.130
Of course, they are.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.850
The cipher intelligence system
of the China Expeditionary Army in Shanghai,

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.090
from top to bottom,

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:39.130
has been spun around
by a small-time actor.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.940
If that's not foolish, what is?

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.500
Lin Megumi,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.220
you're nothing but a nobody.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.850
You have no right
to insult the Imperial Army.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.940
I'll ask you one last time.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.610
Was Taro's death

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.740
connected to you?

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.500
Sadly, no.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.370
But I can promise you this.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.660
Your death will definitely be
linked to me.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.740
You little brat, go to hell.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.940
Or maybe you should go first.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.730
So you could see all along.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.780
Knew you were a liar.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:34.860
Joseph.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.380
Joseph.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.300
Joseph.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.820
A bomb, it's a bomb!

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:49.690
Joseph.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:51.730
Stay back.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.980
Don't come any closer.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.570
The grip's already loose.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.500
I can't hold on much longer.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.130
I'm about to lose my grip.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:59.500
Don't panic.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:02.500
Let me help you.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.130
Stay back!

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.820
Shut up!

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.690
I saw them put that vest on you.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.130
I know how to disarm it.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.820
Can you still hold on?

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.500
Alright.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.730
Hold on.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.690
Hold the grenade.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.210
Lieutenant General,

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.300
don't go in.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.210
There's a bomb inside.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.500
A bomb!

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:45.900
We can't go in.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.380
There's a well on your right.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.820
I'll walk there with you.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.460
Let's slow down.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.570
I've imagined it more than once.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.130
One day,

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.980
I'll hold your hand tight

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.820
in the morning sun.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:06.460
But I never expected

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.340
it would be under these circumstances.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:33.690
The night is almost over.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.340
Dawn is just ahead.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.250
Comrade Ding Yi.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:01.610
We will see the sunrise.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:03.610
I'll count to three.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.900
We let go together.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.860
I'll follow your lead.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.940
One.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:28.940
Two.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.090
Three.
