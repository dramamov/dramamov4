to evacuate.

She's never gotten used
to the environment here.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.660
I remember after Deputy Chief Chen
from China Hong Kong Bureau died,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.050
that position's been vacant, right?

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.380

help you get this done,

I also have

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.540
a list of the New Government's
undercover bases.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.100
I believe this list

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.410
will push you to find a solution faster.

to the memorial hall

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.700

make the final call?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.580
Right. That's right.

born to the Grand Duke and his assistant
during his tenure

as the Civil Governor in China Taiwan.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.410

she's never been officially
acknowledged.

and styling her hair
in a traditional bun,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.410
clearly identifying more
with her Japanese identity.

Remember, don't call her Miss Lin.

She definitely doesn't want anyone

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.080
to bring up her identity
as an illegitimate child.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.290
Calling her Miss Lin
is her biggest taboo.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.850
Are you going to cover for him

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.290

She's ruthless and impulsive by nature.

Just calling her Miss Lin in public

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.460
was enough to make Lin Megumi
want him dead.

Sasaki deliberately brought up
her mother's surname

represent the Tonoji family,

is Deputy Commander,

you'd trade me away?

why you end up like this today?

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.010
It's because
you didn't think it through.

under house arrest and censorship.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.250
I was worried that asking you for help

Dr. Edward is British

fearing being accused of treason,

so we had to find a compromise

why didn't you tell me?

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.770
There are many people who resist Japan.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.880
We kept this trip strictly confidential

why you pretended
to be the Grand Duke's sworn son.

to come to China for cipher work.

But it was leaked by their own people,

and they made Joseph take the blame.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.490
If it weren't for his status
being the sworn son,

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.370
he would probably have...

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.650
Megumi,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.610
if you were in my position,

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.890
what would you do?

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.770
At least you shouldn't lie.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.530
None of the privileges
the Grand Duke promised me

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.940
have been realized.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.890
So does that make him a liar?

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.370
How dare you!

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.890
But that's what war is.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.490
Every time war comes,

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.370
morality is the first casualty.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.090
The Grand Duke took me
from the ivory tower

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:49.890
to the battlefield.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.890
It was bad enough he gave me no weapon.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.890
He shouldn't tie my hands and feet,

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.580
and expect me to uphold morality

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.110
when I'm facing the barrel of a gun.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.770
I'm sorry,

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.770
but I just want to survive.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.460
Looks like the Chinese battlefield

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.730
is far more tangled
than I ever imagined.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.770
That's why I had Biyun

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.180
pretend her leg hadn't healed,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.330
keeping her in this hospital.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.770
I'm just worried

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.770
if something happens to me one day,

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.890
it might implicate her.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.530
I also told her

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.060
in times of crisis
she could turn to you for help.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.100
Do you think the Army Hospital is safe?

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.530
At least under the Tonoji's family's
protection,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.490
Biyun would be safe for sure.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.610
Not necessarily.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.490
As far as I know,

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.010
a doctor's badge was stolen
from the Army Hospital.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.370
That means an enemy
might've already slipped in.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.700
Slipped in to do what?

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.530
Are they after the Grand Duke?

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.900
Sorry to interrupt.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.860
The clamp handle
was deliberately filed thin,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.380
so pressing it hard would cut the hand,

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.330
making the doctor unable
to perform surgeries for a while.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.620
There was some unknown drug on it.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.860
And Dr. Edward's thumb

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.660
did indeed have a wound.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.050
Have you confirmed the identity
of that body?

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:40.140
Yes, but he wasn't Dr. Abe Shoichi.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.810
He just stole Dr. Abe's badge.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.660
He was using the alias Hashimoto Taro.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.050
He worked as a Code Officer
in the Pacification Committee.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.570
In fact, he was Major General Sasaki's
only son,

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.570
Sasaki Taro.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:05.620
He was assassinated by someone
who resists Japan this morning.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.380
The Sasaki family
has already taken his body.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.220
Sasaki!

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.380
What on earth happened?

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.330
The doctor whom the Tonoji family

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.900
had brought all the way from the UK

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.660
was poisoned right under our noses.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.810
You still claim the Hospital is safe.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.700
Where is there any safety?

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.810
Poisoned?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.700
Well…

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:34.730
That's impossible.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.810
You can't see with your eyes,
so naturally you don't understand.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.620
Megumi, I need you to calm down.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.530
I think there's more to this
than it seems.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.220
Now all of us

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.560
are hoping the Grand Duke wakes up soon

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.330
and takes charge again.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.490
Why would anyone

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:54.140
want to poison the Grand Duke's
chief surgeon?

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.700
Of course, it's Sasaki.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.700
The night before last, I saw someone

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.050
walk out of Dr. Edward's office.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.180
His badge said Abe Shoichi.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.900
He had a crescent-shaped scar
on his hand,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.570
identical to the one on the body

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.490
of Sasaki's son.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.460
He must be the one

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.290
who poisoned Dr. Edward.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.180
And Sasaki was behind all of it.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.050
I remember.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.900
I've met Sasaki's son before.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.050
He really did have a scar on his hand.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.980
It's crescent-shaped.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.330
But...

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.660
Go ahead, Biyun, but what?

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.620
But Sasaki would say

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.700
that scar can be faked.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.900
Of course he'd say that.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.860
That could never fool my eyes.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.090
Wait.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.380
I remember the Cryptography Institute

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.050
got a cipher from a private radio.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.810
And this radio

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.220
transmitted steadily

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.660
at exactly 1:30 PM every day.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.220
When we just began decoding it,

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.570
Sasaki suddenly gave a strict order

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.490
to destroy

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.700
all the radio's records immediately.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.490
Megumi,

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.700
could it be that this radio

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.620
actually belongs to Sasaki himself?

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.860
He's planning to use this radio
to give orders

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.940
for a series of moves
against the Tonoji family.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.660
Joseph...

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.570
General Yasui,

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.180
I need the Military Police Headquarters

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.570
to send me a radio direction finder.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.420
Please hurry.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.700
Are you tired of living?

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.900
I told you not to come,
yet here you are.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.090
I shouldn't have come, my bad.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.570
Hold on a second.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:43.930
I've got clothes ready for you.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.330
And a gun. I put it right here.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.090
I've spoken to the person
in charge here.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.180
Those evil guys outside

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.220
won't disturb your rest.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.860
Try to bear with it here.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.900
So in your eyes, they're evil.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:05.900
What about me?

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:10.570
What about me?

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.380
In your eyes, there's no real difference

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.180
between me and them, right?

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.370
What are you talking about?

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.050
You are my comrade-in-arms.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.380
How could you be the same as them?

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.220
You still don't know anything until now?

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.900
Hasn't Liang Jingyuan told you a thing?

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.180
He has.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.900
He told me the condition
for getting you out

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.330
is the Deputy Chief
of China Hong Kong Bureau.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:08.090
You've been through a lot.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.090
Don't burden yourself with thoughts.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.900
Secretary Mao has arranged a boat
for you.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.860
You'll leave by water
before sunset tomorrow.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.180
I might not be able to see you off.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.900
I have to rush back right away.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.900
If Sasaki finishes
the Spirit Transfer Ritual,

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.900
then it'll be too late for everything.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.220
You can't stay here.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.740
I originally intended

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.940
to expose the fact
that Ding Yi and Xian Biyun

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.900
were communists,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.460
and then pin everything on them.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.460
But in the end, I couldn't fool Sasaki.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.900
He'll definitely keep questioning you.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.130
You can't go back there.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.700
Relax, I have my own plan.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.700
There's no way.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.500
The Communist Party will definitely
confront us openly.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.260
Luo Han, at Yuyin Pavilion,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.460
was there something
I didn't know happened?

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:14.220
Ding Yi fired at me.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.130
He wanted to…to kill me.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:29.500
You're saying Ding Yi fired at you?

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.700
The Communist Party
has always played hardball.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.900
Luo Han, I don't know why Ding Yi

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.700
would fire at you.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.890
The two sides hold different positions

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.230
and are in different places.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.460
But if Ding Yi was caught first today,

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.940
we would pull that trigger too.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.090
At this point,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.940
would you really shoot Ding Yi?

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.180
Don't worry.
I'll take that shot for sure.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.980
Liang Jingyuan...

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.940
Are you really taking him back
to Chongqing?

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.130
Luo Han,

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.020
I've got my own plan.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.220
A shameless traitor to his own people.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.460
Just because he did you a favor,

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.940
he'll get the position
of the Deputy Chief.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.460
What about me?

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.460
What's my life worth in exchange?

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.940
Luo Han, what's wrong with you today?

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.900
Didn't I tell you to wait downstairs?

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.940
Sorry to interrupt.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.740
I just want to ask when we're leaving.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.900
We'll go meet someone right now.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.740
He's in charge of everything
for your trip back to Chongqing.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.180
Liang Jingyuan,

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.900
what exactly did you promise Chongqing?

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.980
Same as you.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.940
A loyal heart devoted to the country.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.240
[Sasaki's private radio room]

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.700
Don't move!

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.700
Stay still.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.460
Search for it!

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.700
Don't move!

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.700
Take it all away!

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.850
We've found Sasaki's private radio
and the codebook.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.700
We're interrogating his radio operator.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.260
General Yasui,

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.420
if you still refuse to hand over

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.260
the letter framing the Tonoji family
to me...

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.940
Once I uncover

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.460
concrete proof Sasaki planned
to assassinate the Grand Duke,

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.460
you'll be guilty
of shielding a criminal.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.560
[Denunciation Letter]

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.130
The handwriting on the letter

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.220
exactly matches Sasaki's handwriting.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.370
He accused us of colluding
with British and American forces,

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.460
and also accused Dr. Edward

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.460
of being a spy for the British MI6.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.460
He claimed meeting him in Shanghai
was treason.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.700
It's beyond ridiculous!

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.930
General Yasui has been
a friend to the Grand Duke for years.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.900
How could he ever let this happen?

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.220
The military is already run
by the Imperial Way faction.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.460
They are just joining forces

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.600
to bully our family
because we have no one to rely on.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.850
Find out the address
for Sasaki's Spirit Transfer Ritual.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.740
Notify everyone

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.940
to come and gather now.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:09.940
Got it.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.220
Go get the doctor, quick.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.130
On it.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.500
Doctor!

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.700
Doctor!

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.130
Doctor!

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.700
To be or not to be.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.360
Such an intriguing question.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.460
Father,

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.370
don't worry.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.460
Without Dr. Edward,

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.130
I'll still find you another doctor
from the UK.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.940
Joseph, the Grand Duke wants to see you.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.700
I'm so glad you're awake.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.330
What are you doing here?

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.460
Father,

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.900
don't you remember?

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.420
Three years ago,
you invited Joseph to China

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.900
to help the Expeditionary Army
with their cipher work.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.700
Joseph has done a good job
over the years.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:34.700
He now runs the Wang Government's
Cryptography Institute.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.420
He's not Joseph.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.740
Back then I invited Joseph

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.740
to be the chief advisor
on cryptography for the Kwantung Army.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:53.660
He had no interest at all.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.660
So why would he agree to run

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.460
a small research institute?

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.050
You're not Joseph.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.900
Who are you?

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.900
Perhaps you don't remember me.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:22.940
But

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.610
you should know this photo.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.260
This is a photo

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.260
of him with you.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.500
This photo,

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.610
you took at that time.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:59.460
Right?

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:02.940
Yes.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.180
You used the camera

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:10.380
for the first time.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:12.860
Yes.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.690
A that time, I failed to take photos
many times

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.570
and wasted a bit of film.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.380
It's alright.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.380
You did it nicely.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.500
Sadly,

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.730
I tried many times back then

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:43.650
but failed.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:48.500
In the end, Joseph Lee's father
took the photo.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.820
Joseph had an exceptional memory
since childhood.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.020
If you really are Joseph Lee,

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.570
there's no way you'd get this wrong.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.610
Who are you?

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.500
Take him down.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.250
Take them down.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:06.500
Take them down.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.340
Father,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.820
are you alright?

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.570
Doctor, hurry!

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.050
Please!

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.500
Hurry!

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:22.530
Doctor!

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.730
The Grand Duke's blood pressure
is spiking fast.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.340
It might be a sign of another stroke.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.500
We need emergency care right now.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.730
Father!

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.210
Father!

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.210
Keep an eye on them.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.730
Got it.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.300
This location list he gave us

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.690
doesn't seem fake.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.300
However, you need to give me some time,

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.980
so I can find someone to verify it.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.300
Since it's his show of loyalty,

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.570
it definitely isn't fake.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.650
Let me bring him in.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:23.980
Yangshan.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:27.980
Once it's verified, we won't keep him.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.820
Is that your idea or Chongqing's?

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.980
You get intel,

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.690
and catch the one
who blew up Shanghai Bureau.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.820
Do you think it's my idea,

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.210
or an order from above?

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.090
But here's what I think.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.530
No matter whose idea it is,

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:55.690
the Chairman won't hesitate to award

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.500
a Yunhui Medal, right?

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.570
Mr. Cao?

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.500
Alright, you're grown now.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.210
You're right about that.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:12.500
Liang Jingyuan deserves
everyone's justice.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.050
I've already settled it. Get in.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.210
Young Master,

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.820
I know this is Cao Yuanzhong's place.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.820
I've already helped you.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.090
But you can't throw me into danger.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.500
How about this?

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.690
If you're still uneasy,

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.860
we can just head back.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.730
I trust you completely.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.980
Besides, this path is my own choice.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.690
And having you with me

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.530
is an honor for me.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:05.690
Is there anything else to say?

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.730
Tell me everything.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.820
Megumi,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.710
I've risked my life
for the Tonoji family

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.340
in the New Government.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:15.380
But because of a photo, you...

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.210
Alright.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.980
Still putting on an act, huh?

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.980
Isn't it enough?

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.090
Are you okay?

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.210
Your eyes can see now.

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:41.780
Guess you really are a married couple.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.820
At least you didn't lie to me
about that.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.610
But you do play the part well.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:53.820
You even look exactly like Joseph.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.380
Whoever found you
must've put in serious effort.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.530
No one sent me here.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:05.500
I came on my own.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.610
Shut your mouth.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.730
Don't be so impulsive.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:10.610
My name is Ding Yi.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.210
I'm an actor with the Chaosheng Troupe.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.020
Joseph Lee himself came to hire me.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.980
The Grand Duke invited him to Shanghai.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.440
He was afraid of being assassinated
by those who resisted Japan,

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.380
so he hired me to be his double.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:37.530
Always cautious, putting safety
above all else.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.500
Sounds exactly like something
Joseph would do.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:42.860
So where is he now?

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.210
I killed him.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.820
And then you took his place.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.730
Why?

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:54.690
Because Sasaki's people

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:56.650
took my sister Zhu Hongyu's life.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.090
But fate was on my side.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.500
Joseph Lee found me

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.820
and wanted me to be his double.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:06.820
It was destiny.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.690
So I swore to avenge my sister.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.400
As long as they worked for Sasaki,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.610
including Joseph Lee,

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:15.210
I wouldn't spare a single one!

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:20.820
What about her?

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.780
She's the leader of the troupe

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:24.860
and also...

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.130
And also my wife.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.130
That's right.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.340
Without this social butterfly,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.690
you couldn't possibly have pretended
to be an Englishman

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.250
and fooled so many people.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:52.020
Looks like you told me the truth
just now.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.690
But you've misused the name
of the Tonoji family

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.690
to sow discord within the military.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:09.020
Allowing you to live until now

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.900
is a disgrace to the Tonoji family,

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.440
and even more so to the Imperial Army.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.380
I won't let this mistake continue
any longer.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:25.530
Wait!

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.690
Miss Megumi,

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:30.980
I know, I deserve to die.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:32.730
But I can't die yet,

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.990
because I'm still useful to you.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.690
Sasaki

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.170
sent a telegram, wrote a report letter,

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:41.860
and poisoned Dr. Edward.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.050
These are all facts you saw
with your own eyes.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:46.130
I don't have the ability to fake it.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.690
Give me a gun right now.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:49.860
I can kill him for you

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.210
to protect the dignity
of the Tonoji family.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.860
Ding Yi!

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.340
Giving a gun to a con man?

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.340
Sorry.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.690
I'm not that foolish.

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:04.340
You have to believe me!

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.570
Sasaki still doesn't know

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:07.530
that my eyes can see.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.690
So only if I go,

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:10.690
only then

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:12.730
will he have no defenses at all.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:14.210
Then I can finish him.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:15.730
I'm begging you, please.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:16.820
Let me kill him.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.690
If I can avenge my sister,

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.330
I'm willing to face death
without regret.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.340
But I have only one request.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.340
Let my wife go.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.690
Ding Yi, don't be reckless!

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:30.730
If you go, you won't come back.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.050
Shut up!

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:46.860
I never intended to come back.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:51.650
Miss, the doctor is out.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.170
He wants to see you.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:55.570
Father!

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:56.730
Watch over them.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:57.300
Yes, sir.
