00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.740
(Yide Hall)

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.180
(Li Xu, Crown Prince)

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.620
(Not confined to one aspect,
excluding dissenters)

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.260
(Zhao Xunzhi, Grand Tutor)

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.690
Take a seat.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.660
The Crown Prince started to learn early.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.620
Now, he also has

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.980
his own unique insights.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.700
His Majesty must be pleased.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.780
Congratulations.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.830
Today, let's end it here.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.420
Zhao Xunzhi

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.220
has long spoken of retiring,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.260
but he still teaches in Hongwen Academy.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.740
When I see him,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.940
I even have to call him Grand Tutor.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.700
Xu,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.900
talk to your father

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.220
and let the Vice Prefect teach you.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.580
He is young

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.100
and talented.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.300
You'll learn more from him.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.740
Aunt,

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.220
Mr. Lin was summoned to the Capital.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.700
Father has his own plans for him.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.100
Mr. Zhao is quite good as a teacher.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.020
But why have you

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.120
been mentioning Mr. Lin so often lately?

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.300
In the Capital,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.980
there are only two people

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.020
whom I can regard as confidants.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.180
Lin Yan

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.100
is one of them.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.900
Father and you

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.660
both appreciate him so much.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.300
He must have extraordinary qualities.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.620
(The Princess favors Mr. Lin.)

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.820
Have Anran see me asap.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.760
Yes.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.820
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.820
The Prince is so urgent

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.720
in calling me back.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.820
What's wrong?

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.060
Please go in quickly.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.740
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.820
I was worried along the way

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.080
and changed horses three times.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.900
Yet you're still drinking tea.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.100
Anran,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.340
I've been brewing this tea for a while,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.500
waiting for you to drink it.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.940
Take a sip first.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.460
Actually, it's not

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.860
an urgent matter at all.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.860
I've heard

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.780
that the Princess favors you.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.340
Why not become a close attendant

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.860
to the Princess?

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.400
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.420
You look so scared.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.380
It's alright.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.100
Why are you so shocked to hear this?

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.180
Let me tell you.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.100
When you were a child and sick,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.340
you vomited all over me.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.900
I took care of it myself.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.300
Spitting tea is nothing.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.580
Yes.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.180
You've indeed been a savior

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.460
to me.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.940
Don't say that.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.620
You're alone in the Capital now.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.460
I can't help you,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.100
but the Princess can.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.460
If you marry her,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.930
you may not have a promising future,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.380
but you don't have to.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.780
If you two are together,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.940
she can help your career.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.620
I understand your intentions,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.980
but doing this

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.580
would belittle both me

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.380
and the Princess.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.980
It's not that serious.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.580
Now, many girls in the Capital

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.460
want to marry you,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.220
but if you keep refusing,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.740
they won't find you attractive

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.380
when you're old.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.700
Here's what I think.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.340
Just go along with the Princess.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.540
If she really likes you...

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.020
I've already found out for you

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.140
that Wei Xiangqin,
Military Commissioner,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.900
will be the Minister of War,

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.780
and Song Fangxu, Imperial Attendant,

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.340
will be the Vice Minister of War.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.570
The Princess told you that?

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.980
I've said it before.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.460
You're indeed

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.700
good-looking.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.060
The Princess...

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.660
Why suddenly take an interest

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.380
in the appointment
to the Ministry of War?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.860
Here's the thing.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.740
Guo Pingxu,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.100
the former Minister of War,
is my friend.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.700
He is now on a mission abroad

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.900
and is worried about his position
when he returns.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.140
So,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.980
he asked me to find out.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.900
In fact,

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.500
the official world is like this.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.820
You know,

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.940
His Majesty chose Guo Pingxu,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.140
and now he is dissatisfied,

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.780
so he gives him a promotion
that is actually a demotion.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.180
That's why I hope you

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.340
can find a patron in the Capital.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.540
The former Minister of War

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.140
was chosen by my sixth brother.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.380
The Emperor and I dislike him.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.220
Thank you for your concern.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.540
Since I have to work tomorrow,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.700
I won't stay longer.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.800
Take care of your health.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.740
The water quality in the Capital
is not good.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.540
Come back often to have a cup of tea.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.260
Goodbye.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.900
(Complete and Bright)

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.060
(Complete and Bright)

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.460
(Capital Prefecture)

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:36.900
Anran.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.740
Mr. Pei, why are you here?

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.300
The Shens often send you

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.780
delicious food that they make.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.410
So, I came to share with you,

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.700
but unexpectedly...

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.080
This...

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.340
What do you mean?

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.020
Your Highness.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.670
I have just returned from Leyou Plateau.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.140
I passed by the Prefecture

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.680
and thought I'd drop by.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.820
Be careful of the steps.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.980
Don't fall.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.340
I've obtained some Jiannan Wine,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.860
and I'd like to share it with Mr. Lin

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.860
and Mr. Pei tonight.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:28.820
Come here.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.180
Yangyang.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.380
We must stop our ancestor

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.020
from going.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.180
Why?

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.700
Don't ask why.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.340
Have you seen it on TV at home?

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.300
Those social news reports.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.380
Can you pretend

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.940
to be foolish or sick?

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.860
You can? Good. Come on.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.100
- My goodness.
- Help!

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.940
It hurts.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.060
- Grandpa.
- Yangyang?

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.720
Grandpa.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.200
My leg is broken.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.460
Uncle, Yangyang.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.180
It hurts so much.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.620
- Grandpa, it hurts.
- Uncle.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.700
My goodness.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.660
I can't live like this.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.940
How disgraceful.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.380
Uncle, are you alright?

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.230
It hurts too much.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.660
I can't bear it.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.520
Yangyang, Uncle.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.460
Mr. Pei, it's not good.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.420
Come and help.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.940
Uncle, are you alright?

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.340
- What's going on?
- Uncle, here.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.100
Come on, slowly.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.920
Where are you hurt?

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.220
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.940
- Where are you hurt?
- Where are you hurt?

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.340
This injury is serious.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.260
We need to take them to the clinic asap.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.660
Yes, to the clinic.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.140
Hurry up.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:36.990
Let's go.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.340
Stop.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.340
Mr. Lin, Mr. Pei,

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.020
you don't want to join me,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.900
so you went along

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.740
with their act, right?

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.740
Of course not.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.980
Your Highness, please calm down.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.340
It's an honor to receive

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.660
your invitation.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.180
How could we possibly decline?

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.420
How could they know

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.020
about tonight's banquet

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.680
and thus deceive you?

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.540
Yes.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.380
How about this?

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.620
Anran will take them

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.860
to the clinic for treatment.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.180
I will attend

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.220
the banquet tonight

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.620
and drink with you as much as you want.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.180
In that case,

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.940
it shall be settled.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.740
My goodness.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.980
I was so scared.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.420
You're scared? Really?

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.940
After all, it's the Princess.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.620
Moreover, I could tell

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.260
you didn't want to go.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.660
Thank you.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.820
Go back.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.980
I'll take the food box back

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.980
after I finish.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.620
Alright, let's go.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.770
Yangyang, come on.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.320
Come on.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.460
Your Highness.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.460
How is it?

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.840
Mr. Lin's interaction with officials

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.960
has been as usual recently,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.820
but he's been particularly close

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.220
to Pei Fei, a censor.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.620
I have found out

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.620
that he is simple

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.860
from a humble background.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.380
Anran always makes friends this way,

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.180
treating everyone equally,
regardless of their status.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.540
By the way,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.300
how has his relationship

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.580
with the Princess been?

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.540
He's been avoiding her.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.700
A few days ago,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.380
Mr. Lin prepared gifts for officials
for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.740
Even the Vice Minister of Justice,

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.600
with whom he had no dealings,
received a gift.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.180
But none for the Princess.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.340
The Vice Minister of Justice.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.780
Is it Cao Rong?

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.260
Yes.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.500
(Shen's Diner)

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.900
This is the place you talked about?

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.260
It's far worse
than your Guixiang Tavern.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.420
Don't underestimate

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.900
this place.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.340
It used to be a stall
at the alley entrance,

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.340
and even then, business was good.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.980
Now it can even host

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.640
the Princess's Qixi Poetry Gathering.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.260
(Second Master Huan, scholar)
Lady Shen

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.740
is very ingenious in cooking.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.780
Even the Princess praised her highly.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.380
Is the Princess

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.900
someone worth respecting?

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:49.980
A woman,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.220
gathering many attendants.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.690
She's immoral and unprincipled.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.520
Be careful with your words.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.940
Sirs, what would you like to eat?

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.260
(Menu)

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.340
What is this?

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.260
A menu.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.180
Our dishes

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.860
are listed on this sheet by category.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.940
So, it's called a menu.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.660
(Agate Meat)

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.000
(Everyman's Joy)
How ingenious.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.020
(Bad smell but good taste)

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.060
(Fragrant Crisp)
I'll have

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.220
one of each of these dishes.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.420
(Favored by God of Wealth)

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.180
What is this?

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:27.920
My notebook.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.660
A good memory is
not as good as a bad pen.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.340
This way, I won't get the dishes wrong.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.380
(Favored by God of Wealth)

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.500
You seem a bit frivolous.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.180
The sash around your waist

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.580
can even be casually tugged by a man.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.220
(Favored by God of Wealth)

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.660
What else would you like?

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.620
This menu

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.620
seems to lack

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.220
(Mountain Delicacies Pot)
wine and pepper-flavored snacks.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.500
The poetry gathering used

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.040
to be handled by Guixiang Tavern.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.000
Yet the Princess
entrusted it to you this time.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:11.930
I was puzzled,

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.180
but after tasting your food,

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.220
I am truly convinced.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.940
Oh, it was you.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.540
No wonder you looked familiar.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.700
You still remember the snacks you had

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.300
at the last poetry gathering?

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.140
I'll give you two portions then.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.140
Lady Shen,

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.860
what kind of snacks are these?

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.420
Give us some, too.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.140
Sure, they'll be out in a bit.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.460
Alright.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.340
You're so good at this.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.300
I am Liu Feng,

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.420
the third in my family.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.820
Just call me Feng.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.660
Mr. Liu, nice to meet you.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.620
Please, take a seat.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.540
Are you the owner of this diner?

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.140
This diner is run by my family and me.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.100
With family around,

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.860
why bother to be a waitress yourself?

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.540
Will you still be able to get married?

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.660
Mr. Huan,

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.680
stop it.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.930
I'm sorry, Lady Shen.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.620
It's alright.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.380
Sir,

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.260
marriage,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.300
clothing and food.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.180
If you taste the dishes from my diner,

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.700
you'll know I can afford clothes

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.540
and enjoy good meals.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.950
I'm not in a hurry to get married.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.020
Your frivolous reputation is set,

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.140
yet you're not in a hurry?

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.340
Perhaps even your family

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.580
will be talked about.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.420
Mr. Huan.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.540
I behave properly
and run my business legitimately.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.820
If someone thinks I'm frivolous,

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.260
it's because they have a dirty mind.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.780
Sir, you're so rude,

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.260
unlike someone from a noble family

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.340
or someone
who can pass the imperial exams.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.820
You should focus on self-cultivation.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.740
Mr. Huan.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.620
You look like a hag,

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.640
and your temper is so bad.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.460
I will never step foot
in such a diner again.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.820
- Mr. Huan.
- You're the ugly one.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.720
After a thousand years,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.500
many people will think I'm beautiful.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.580
You have no vision at all.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.500
Lady Shen's mouth

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.980
- Lady Shen.
- never spares anyone.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.060
Let's eat.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.020
I'm sorry.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.780
Mr. Huan is such a stickler,

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.940
but I didn't expect

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.940
that he'd say such nonsense.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.420
From now on,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.920
I will never associate with him again.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.740
I drove away your friend

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.220
and put you in an awkward position,

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.340
but you don't blame me?

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.100
Mr. Huan's rude words

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.940
deserved a lesson.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.020
Moreover, I am a businessman.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.000
I understand one thing:

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.420
If others have targeted me

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.380
and I don't fight back,

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.620
my business

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.700
can't go on.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.380
I've heard

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.780
about your innovative stir-frying.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.360
Compared to steaming and boiling,

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.860
it adds another layer of fragrance.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.020
Stir-frying

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.580
can use the high temperature in the oil

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.420
to remove the juices

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.660
from vegetables and fresh meat,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.260
making the texture crispy,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.400
so it will be more fragrant.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.540
To make stir-fried dishes,

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.740
one must use an iron pot.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.460
You have no reservations.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.860
I'm impressed.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.980
To be honest,

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.860
I've also learned from Guixiang Tavern.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.640
Guixiang Tavern is elegant and simple,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.060
quiet amidst the hustle and bustle.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.020
Guests sit around
without appearing disorderly.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.460
It seems you have

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.980
a good understanding of the layout.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.140
(Shen's Diner)

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.620
I've hosted so many banquets
to invite Mr. Lin,

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.780
but he never came.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.620
I was wondering why he came today.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:26.880
You

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.120
failed the exams repeatedly,

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.420
so I wanted to ask Mr. Lin

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.100
what the court's criteria are
for officials.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.540
But he told me

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.760
the court values scholars

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.220
who are cautious

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.660
in speech and action.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.620
I went out and found out

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.420
that you offended Lady Shen.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.140
Who in the Capital doesn't know

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.380
that the Shen family

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.700
and Mr. Lin are relatives?

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.740
Uncle,

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.780
I'm busy studying.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.700
Where would I learn about that?

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.420
You're just a distant relative
from Xiangzhou.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.100
If not for your father,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.700
how could you stay here
to take the exams?

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.380
How dare you offend the Vice Prefect?

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.230
Tomorrow,

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.820
go and apologize to Lady Shen.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.020
As a scholar,

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.760
how can I apologize to a tavern girl?

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.540
Whatever you are,

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.340
you must go and apologize.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.020
You look down on tavern girls?

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.780
She's more accomplished than you.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.020
She earns everything

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.420
on her own.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.320
What about you?

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.220
You're still living under my roof.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.060
How could you say that to me?

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.340
Isn't it all because of Lin Yan?

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.060
Am I afraid of him?

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.500
Lady Shen, I'm sorry.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.860
Yesterday, I was drunk

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.220
and said that nonsense.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.580
(Shen's Diner)
Please accept

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.180
these small gifts.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.420
Please forgive me.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.300
If you're no longer angry,

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.620
please send a message to Mr. Lin.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.700
Tell him I'm grateful for his teachings

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.820
and will always remember them.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.540
Mr. Lin?

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:04.940
Yes.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.500
That's what I wanted to say.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.540
You must be busy,

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.740
so I won't disturb you.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.420
(Shen's Diner)

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.180
Didn't you come to apologize to me?

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.980
You brought so many gifts

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.820
and took them away
after showing them to me?

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.020
What a cunning and bad man.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.580
Why is it you today?

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.980
I want to thank you in person.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.380
Mr. Huan caused trouble,

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.180
and you spoke up for me, right?

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.740
Yesterday, the food box

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.220
was left at the diner's entrance.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.690
You clearly came.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.860
Why didn't you go in?

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.460
You were talking happily

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.840
with the owner of Guixiang Tavern.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.540
I didn't want to disturb you.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.180
Guixiang Tavern is doing very well,

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.180
so I thought I should

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.860
take the chance to learn some secrets.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.380
Speaking of which, Mr. Liu

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.060
is not quite what I thought.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.040
I originally thought

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.320
that a rich boy like him would be

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.500
very hard to get along with,

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.820
but he is not only kind

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.060
but also clear-headed.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.460
A rich boy?

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.540
It means his parents are rich

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.380
and can protect him,

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.380
so he's a rich boy.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:20.640
Speaking of which,

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.760
the Lius are an old, wealthy family.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.220
Mr. Liu's family is well-off,

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.060
and he's handsome.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.260
There must be quite a few young ladies

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.600
in Yong'an who like him.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.060
What's wrong with you?

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.340
Has the fish meat

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.660
gone bad?

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.700
Is it sour?

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.940
I'm just not used to vinegar.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:45.990
I forgot to say.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.100
This is Vinegar Cabbage.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.300
Vinegar used to be fine.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.060
Why afraid of sourness today?

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.340
What's wrong?

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.620
A fish bone got stuck.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.660
I swallowed it.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.020
Lady Shen is trying
to murder her husband.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:31.980
Mr. Pei,

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.380
our engagement has been canceled.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.660
Don't speak nonsense

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.970
and tarnish her reputation.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:37.820
Canceled?

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:38.900
Yes.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.750
Why?

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.100
Recently, many censors
have been wondering

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.840
why you ordered so many mooncakes

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.060
from Shen's Diner

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.660
and reprimanded Mr. Huan.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.300
Some even asked me

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.100
if you were to marry Lady Shen.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.220
I couldn't say

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.940
that you two were engaged,

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.060
so I came to ask you

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.660
how I should respond,

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.100
yet you told me this news.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.180
The censors are just too idle,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.580
gossiping about these things.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.980
You can't say that.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.540
The Censorate is supposed to report
based on hearsay.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.420
Besides,
you are the focus of the censors.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.060
Why?

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.140
Of course.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.300
You see,

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.340
you are upright,

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.620
your career is smooth,

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.540
and you're good-looking.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.020
You're just a bit older for marriage.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:32.420
In the Censorate,

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.300
who wouldn't want

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.780
to marry their sister to you?

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.540
I don't think

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.540
you want to break off the engagement.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.580
I told you so.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.900
If you like her,

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.260
you should say it.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.380
With your cold attitude,

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.660
how would Lady Shen know you like her?

00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.710
If you say it,

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.640
she will understand.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.020
You'd still be engaged then.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.460
Stop. What nonsense.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.220
You're just like this.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.900
You always

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.940
overthink everything.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.500
I'm warning you.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.860
If you miss out on Lady Shen,

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.620
you'll regret it in the future.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.020
You two

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:21.940
are a good match.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.940
It's mutual affection,

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.780
not like a forced marriage,

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:27.940
which is never sweet.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.380
You sound

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.820
like you're being coerced

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.900
into a marriage.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:38.860
Me?

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.360
There's no such thing.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.220
No one would like me.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.300
Mr. Lin,

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.760
Mr. Pei,

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.620
the Princess sent me

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.660
to invite you two

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.060
to the mansion today

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.620
to compose poetry.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.340
Didn't I just go yesterday?

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:57.940
Why are you here again?

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.660
Please tell the Princess...

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:01.660
Thank her for her favor,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.260
but I have to write memorials today

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.340
and don't have time to go.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.860
The Princess anticipated that

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.860
and prepared a banquet
for tomorrow evening,

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.060
waiting for you both.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.250
I still...

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.420
How considerate.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.100
Yet I have documents to review tomorrow.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.980
As a censor,

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.220
I should prioritize public duties.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.540
I can't go.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.820
It's a pity.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.340
I hope the Princess will understand.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.940
Me too.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.500
I hope the Princess will understand.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.940
Since you insist,

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.900
I won't disturb you further.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.940
I notice that you seem

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.900
particularly afraid to see the Princess.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.980
Did something happen yesterday

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.500
when you were drinking?

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.380
No.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.260
You don't want to see the Princess.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.660
You don't want to do that,

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.620
so I made up an excuse.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.380
It's true.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.180
Your Highness,

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.100
Mr. Lin and Mr. Pei claimed to be busy

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.060
and couldn't make it today or tomorrow.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.520
It doesn't matter.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.140
The cakes from Guixiang Tavern

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.920
are too sweet.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.370
I'm starting to miss

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.260
the meals from Shen's Diner.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.700
Go and invite Lady Shen here

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.420
to cook a meal for me.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.580
Yes.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.660
Some people don't like

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.300
poetry or flowers,

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.860
but food and sex

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.380
are in human nature.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.980
If I cater to their preferences,

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.860
they will come eventually.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.700
You're a guest.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.220
Please.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.980
We are close friends.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:15.980
No need for this.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.340
Anran,

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.620
you

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.300
go ahead.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.060
Even among close friends,

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.800
there are still rules of hospitality.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.040
Mr. Pei, please.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:25.900
No, no.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.660
Anran, you go first.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.900
Mr. Pei, you go first.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.740
You go ahead.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.780
You go ahead.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.860
Young Master, Mr. Pei,

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.820
the Princess sent a message,

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.660
inviting you two to have a meal.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.580
We already declined at noon.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.660
Tell the messenger

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.420
that we are discussing official business

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.340
and

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.740
have already eaten.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.340
Yes, we are eating right now.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.540
But the Princess invited

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.100
Lady Shen to prepare the evening meal.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.870
- Prepare the horse.
- Yes.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.660
Mr. Pei, let's go together.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.460
No, I won't go.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.780
I just remembered

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.980
I have guests at home.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.180
I have to go back right away.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.020
You have to go.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.140
I won't go.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:08.980
You have to go.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.740
If you want to go, go by yourself.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.300
You won't go?

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.740
Do you really not fear the Princess?

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.820
I don't want to see her.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.980
I'm not afraid of her.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.140
- Go with me.
- No.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.460
- You have to go.
- I...

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.540
I won't go, no matter what.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.580
She won't eat you.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.780
Still, I won't go.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.320
Can you bear to leave me alone

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.160
to face the Princess?

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.720
Yes.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.220
If you want to go, go by yourself.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:26.740
I won't go.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.180
Anran, Anran.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.500
Put me down, Anran.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.820
Put me down.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.660
Are you even human?

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.300
Are you even human?

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.340
(Capital Prefecture)

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.300
Lady Shen.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.980
Eating alone is so boring.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.060
Why don't you

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.340
stay and have a meal with me?

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.020
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.340
I would be delighted.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.620
But I haven't finished

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.500
the melon wine yet.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.540
How about I make it here,

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.100
so I can talk with you?

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.940
That'd be great.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.980
Mr. Lin and Mr. Pei are here.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.980
Mr. Lin and Mr. Pei will join us?

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.640
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.720
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.140
Mr. Pei and I couldn't decline anymore

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.620
and finished our official duties.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.900
We're here to apologize.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.620
Mr. Pei and I...

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.900
Mr. Lin and I

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.540
are here to apologize.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.740
Join us for a meal.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.020
Thanks, Your Highness.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.800
Your Highness,

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.160
I've already eaten.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.540
Then eat again.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.740
(The Princess asked me to cook)

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.180
(because of the ancestor?)

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.260
(Wait a minute.)

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.820
(What if she knows)

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.420
(about the fake engagement between us?)

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.020
(Will she target me?)

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.580
Lady Shen,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.860
I heard that you are Mr. Lin's cousin,

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.060
but you seem

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.940
quite a match to me.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.100
You must be joking.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.820
Between Mr. Lin and me,

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.660
it's just mutual care among relatives.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.380
I don't deserve Mr. Lin.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.620
That's not true.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.300
I don't think Lin Anran would mind.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.420
He would.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.340
I mean,

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.920
Mr. Lin should be with a young lady

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.060
who is well-born, well-read,

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.060
and good-looking.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.000
If he chose someone not good enough,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.480
I'd mind on his behalf.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.140
So,

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.700
what do you think

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.820
is good enough

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.500
and what is not good enough?

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.300
Take me, for example.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.340
How do you see me?

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.100
You're a top-notch beauty,

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.700
and should be with a man

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.840
who is well-born, well-read,

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.500
and good-looking.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.540
I am not

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.260
a match at all.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.220
Moreover,

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.580
I already have someone I admire.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.180
No wonder you

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.220
always refuse my invitations.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.320
You think I'm interested...

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.580
You all think I'm interested

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.260
in Mr. Lin?

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.220
Mr. Pei.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.220
Pei,

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.140
who do you think

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.740
I want to see?

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.580
Who?

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.700
Then let me tell you again.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.820
At the Qixi Poetry Gathering,

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.220
it was the first time I saw Mr. Pei.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.180
That day,

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.300
the way he played the guqin

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:15.700
was elegant and unrestrained

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.940
like a Wei-Jin scholar.

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.580
How charming.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.620
From then on,

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.580
my eyes could no longer

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.500
tolerate anyone else.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.780
People say Ruan Ji secluded himself

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.500
and played Wine Mad

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.820
to express his inner distress,

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.140
but I think

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.580
he was truly willing

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.540
to forget his worries in wine.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.260
But this man in front of me

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.660
is the one who played Wine Mad

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.580
with the right spirit.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.980
You know my feelings,

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.020
yet you always avoid me.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.740
My husband is seriously ill,

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.420
and I have to take care of him
until the end,

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.300
but I don't want to neglect myself.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.420
Yet, Mr. Pei always avoids me.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.980
When he came to drink yesterday,

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.820
he was afraid to say anything.

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.060
I had no choice

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.500
but to try to get close to you

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.460
through Mr. Lin.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.740
I even invited Lady Shen here.

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.140
I didn't expect

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.940
to cause a misunderstanding.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:37.900
Anran,

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.020
from now on,

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.500
you should visit me more often.

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:46.500
You can even

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.340
bring friends along.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.340
It was my presumption

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.620
that caused the misunderstanding.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.540
Yes, it was a misunderstanding.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.220
Your Highness,

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.620
you misunderstood me.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.060
Mr. Pei,

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.180
my feelings for you

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.250
are not a misunderstanding.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.900
One day,

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.460
I will make you understand.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.020
(So, the Princess
has her eye on Mr. Pei.)

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.940
(The Shen family is safe for now.)

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.540
(But the ancestor said
he had someone he admired.)

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.700
(Who could it be?)

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.380
(The female ancestor
hasn't made an appearance yet.)

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.380
Cosmetics and powders!

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.420
Thanks to you for relaxing the curfew.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.060
Even though the sun has set,

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.380
the market is still bustling.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.660
You've done such a great job.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.620
Why suddenly praise me?

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.380
I'm being grateful, okay?

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.860
You've been so kind

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:03.720
to our family.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.820
I can't do much in return,

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.740
but I can at least give you
emotional value.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.580
Emotional value?

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.340
You mean to flatter me?

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.860
I just want to make you happy.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.180
Besides, in Juxian Alley,

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.940
everyone's praising you.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.620
The manager of the clothing shop

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.780
says you are
the best capital official in history.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.180
The cloth seller says

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.380
you truly consider
the people's interests.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.460
The young man of the bookshop says

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.940
you are the best-looking official.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.380
What is all this about?

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.700
Have you eaten enough just now?

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.300
Do you want to buy some food?

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.340
I'm full.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.740
It was so interesting just now.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.700
The drama's made me full.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.220
The drama?

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:49.980
Laugh if you want to.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.140
So, you also have moments of narcissism,

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.780
thinking that the Princess likes you.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.140
Narcissism?

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.940
It doesn't sound like a good word.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:02.280
Take a look.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.220
I don't want it.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.580
In the Western Regions,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.180
a man saw his peerless beauty

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.180
in the reflection in the water.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.980
Then, he neither ate nor drank,

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.620
just admired himself by the shore,

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.900
and turned into a narcissus.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.500
That's narcissism.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.220
But just now, you said

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.740
that you have someone you admire.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:28.580
Is it true?

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.220
Yes.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:37.980
Excuse me.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:39.900
Be careful.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.820
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:46.780
Thank you.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.540
You just said you have
someone you admire.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.060
Can I ask who it is?

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:01.820
I didn't finish.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.660
I mean,

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.540
I made it up.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.060
Could you not stop there?

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:08.940
It's quite startling.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:12.980
However,

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.300
you were so quick-witted,

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.740
finding an excuse so soon.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:16.700
That way,

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.500
the Princess can't force you.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.060
But your narcissism this time

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.240
can't be entirely your fault.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.580
What the Princess did

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.380
was indeed quite misleading.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.980
Next time, I'll learn my lesson

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.620
and won't be narcissistic again.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.100
As long as the other party

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.740
hasn't said they like you,

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.060
it doesn't count.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.140
Remember that.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.590
When you're out there,

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.020
you must take good care of yourself.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.150
