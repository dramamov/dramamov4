00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.640
You...

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.560
I'm warning you.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.560
Don't let me catch you again.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.480
It's my parents-in-law's.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.240
Is there a problem with bail?

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.520
If not,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.039
I'll get going.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.880
A pack of cigarettes.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.120
Coming.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.080
Take a look.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.480
What cigarettes do you want?

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.520
Thank you, sir.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.680
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.280
What a coincidence.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.600
What are you doing?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.920
Stop!

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.000
Stop!

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.000
Stop!

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.680
Stop! Stop!

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.480
You asked me to wait for Feng Lei.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.480
You're not that stupid.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.079
Sit down.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.160
Wait for the show.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.960
Let's have a drink.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.120
You bitch!

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.480
Do you really think your husband is dead?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.240
How dare you come here?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.600
Go back!

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.960
Feng Lei, right?

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.640
Who are you?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.440
It doesn't matter who I am.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.120
Let's play a game.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.320
Can't you see I'm teaching my wife?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.720
What game are you playing?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.560
Take it easy.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.280
The game is simple.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.160
Let's rock the dice.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.520
If you're older,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.040
I'll have a drink and kiss you.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.920
If I were older,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.560
I'll slap you.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.520
Have a drink.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.200
it depends on who gets the empty glass in front of us.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.560
If mine is empty,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.680
Wang Yu can go back with you,

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.120
I'll go with you.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.520
But if your vacancy is available,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.360
don't bother Wang Yu anymore.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.360
What do you think?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.400
Do you dare?

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.240
If it doesn't work,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.040
just step aside.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.920
Let us

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.720
I'll show you what a real man is.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.880
Trash.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.680
Fine.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.160
I'd like to see

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.720
what you can do.

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.640
Let's go home.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.760
Bro.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.400
I can't afford to lose.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.360
You lost to a woman and you're still so arrogant.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.600
Are you a man?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.240
You broke your promise.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.600
It's none of your business.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600
Get lost!

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.200
You can't afford to lose and you're scolding me.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.040
Guys, teach him a lesson.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.600
I...

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.240
He's quite arrogant. Hit him.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.000
Are you the patient's family?

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.800
The patient's condition

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.040
may become a vegetative.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.159
You need to be mentally prepared.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.520
Wang Yu.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.680
Leave him alone.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.760
Inform his parents.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.800
Let's go.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.760
The patient is in critical condition.

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.159
Hurry up and get admitted.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.360
so that we can arrange the surgery as soon as possible.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.960
Wang Yu.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.200
Let's go.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.320
Wang Yu.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.240
I give up the treatment.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.320
Wang Yu.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.160
What's wrong, Jinjing?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.760
I'm reborn.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.320
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.680
Where is Wang Yu?

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.840
Jinjing.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.880
Wang Yu.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.640
I'm here

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.920
I'm organizing the files.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.880
After reading these files,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.600
I think

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.280
I should do something

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.520
for them and for myself.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.200
If you're willing,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.880
you can join us.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.640
Join you.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.800
Join us

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.400
and help more people.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.840
Why me?

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.680
Because it tells me you are suitable.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.800
Wang Yu has changed a lot.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.400
Maybe what you did is meaningful.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.480
but I still want to

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.840
a normal life.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.680
Bye.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:11.920
Jin-kyung.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.320
Take care of yourself.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.240
Boss.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.480
It's okay.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.440
We'll meet again.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.280
Wait.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.120
Stay still.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.039
Lock him up for three days and remember.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.600
Head.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.760
Boss, I'll go first.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.320
Zhou Mu.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.480
What's going on?

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.440
Nothing

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.640
I caught a loser who beats women.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.640
Scoundrel.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.280
What are you thinking?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.600
So many chances to be promoted

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.840
to you.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.760
So many big cases.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.880
I'll chew them and feed them to you.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.520
You don't either.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.600
Why are you fighting with these guys?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.920
Don't you know

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.440
Don't you know?
