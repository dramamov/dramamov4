Exactly.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:32.960
Human nature

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.800
is to seek pleasure and avoid pain.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.320
Right.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.470

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.600

But this case

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.730
might be a lingering doubt in my life.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.000
Can you talk about it, Brother?

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.550
There's nothing I can't talk about.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.300
[Premium cigarettes] [Rat glue trap]

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.830
It must be about 7 years now.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.580
Feels like yesterday.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.690
This case

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.150
was the last major case

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.150
I was involved in.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.190
Put it down! Put it down!

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.010
Put it down! All of you!

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.230
Put it down!

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.470
Come down! Bao Defa, come down!

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.790
Come down! Bao Defa, come down!

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.630
Officer!

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.440
Come down! Come down!

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.020
Officer!

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.620
What are you doing, Bao Defa?

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.930
What are you doing?

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.910
What are you doing?

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.440
Keep making trouble,
and I'll take you all in!

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.240
Tell your men

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.000
to stop arguing,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.440
or I'll take everyone who's making trouble
back to the station!

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.390
Stop arguing!

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.880
Everyone, be quiet!

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.630
Where is that person?

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.690
This way, officer!

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.440
This way!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.530
Let's go.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.450
This way, this way.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.460
Go up from here.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.800
Officer, over here.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.240
Be careful, officer. This way.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.160
Officer, over here.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.270
Uncle!

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.910
Officer, this way.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.530
Who's the family member?

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.530
This is the family member, my uncle.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.000
Have you confirmed the identity
of the deceased?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.860
Yes, confirmed.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.220
Injustice.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.510
Injustice.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.770
Injustice.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.890
It's him!

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.360
Old man!

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:06.670
It's him!

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.960
A life for a life!

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.360
What are you doing?

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.550
Nobody's going anywhere!

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.550
No one is leaving!

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.030
Go back!

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:14.720
It's useless to act like this.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.780
What are you doing?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.530
What are you doing? Stop it!

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.880
Put that stone down!

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.630
Sir, it's him.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.840
He caused my brother's death

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.870
and demolished my uncle's house.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.720
Sir,

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.910
we didn't do anything!

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:27.600
It's him!

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.870
He's also from Yafen Village!

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.730
He can testify!

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:30.840
It's all your fault!

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.840
Stop pretending!

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:32.720
You're all to blame!

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.850
The police are here!

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.060
Do you want to be taken to the station?

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.380
Didn't you just say

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.200
you wanted to deal with
their entire village?

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.970
Are you the village secretary?

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:45.870
Over here.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.630
Tell your villagers to disperse.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.840
Don't escalate the situation.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.720
If both villages start fighting,

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.180
it will be hard to resolve.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.960
Respect the dead

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.050
and follow proper procedures.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.770
If we hadn't come today,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.550
you wouldn't know how to handle this.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.080
After you demolished their house,

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.670
do you think the villagers
would let you leave?

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.400
Quickly take your people back.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.630
Brother, I'm just talking nonsense.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.840
Was the team leader

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:22.870
who was in charge of this case

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.630
at that time

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.120
showing favoritism toward the Bao family?

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.030
The first person who discovered

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.550
Xu Qingli's body

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.630
was the one I just mentioned,

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.230
Bao Defa's brother-in-law.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.670
Do you think

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.630
his testimony is reliable?

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.550
So what is

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.080
Bao Defa's relationship

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.670
with the victim

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.950
in the Xu Qingli case?

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.270
Bao Desheng.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.630
Bao Defa.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.750
Cousins.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.120
I see.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.460
From the same village.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.730
I understand now, Uncle Xu.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.320
You're suggesting

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.100
that Xu Qingli's death

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.550
is related to the Bao family.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.200
To determine the cause of death,

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.030
I requested an autopsy at the time.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.750
I wanted to check

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.390
if there was damage
to the respiratory tract.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.550
That would tell us

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.600
whether the body

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.930
was burned after death.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.270
Leader Zhao

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.750
wanted to close the case quickly

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.010
to calm the situation.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.670
The villagers' attitude was even stranger.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.470
They insisted

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.680
the Bao family did it,

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.880
but refused to allow an autopsy.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.500
That security chief

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.260
gathered a group of villagers

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.520
and took the body away.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:30.690
They said,

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.150
"This person is already dead;

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.870
why do you want an autopsy?

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.150
How much more suffering must he endure?"

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.960
Regardless of

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.320
whether it's superstition or not,

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:40.720
in the end,

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.120
neither side objected,

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.910
and the body was buried.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:46.930
A few years later,

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.250
during the big crackdown,

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.440
the Bao family

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.070
was completely uprooted,

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.790
along with Leader Zhao.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.580
They were all exposed.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.480
Later,

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.260
he was released on medical parole,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.320
and not long after,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.200
he was gone.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.840
I regret that I couldn't personally

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.640
catch those Bao family members.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.589
After the Xu Qingli case,

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.869
I took medical retirement
the following year.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:13.690
Actually, I...

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.720
I wanted to work for a few more years.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:18.550
Even if they had transferred me
to a less demanding position,

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.680
I would have been willing to continue.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.359
But they wouldn't agree.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.440
A person's life is like a case file.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:27.510
About what you've accomplished

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.710
and what you haven't,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.990
once the seal is stamped,

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.450
that's the final verdict.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.420
But

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.250
how many chances to be young

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.880
do we get in life?

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.350
Here.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.950
My name is Youth Xu.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.570
Youth without regrets.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.270
Meng.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.160
You have to

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.800
investigate the Xu Qingli case thoroughly.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.460
The path ahead isn't easy.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.280
It's fine.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.470
This building

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.270
is quite dilapidated.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.090
This way, this way.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.110
Yes.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.410
It's right here.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.850
Who's the idiot

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.200
coming so early in the morning?

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.110
Mazai, open the door.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.720
Dong.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.780
Dong.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.700
Weihai Police.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.010
[Police]

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.500
Please come in.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.000
Come in.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:57.960
We're here

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.270
to ask you

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.510
about

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.920
Xu Qingli's matter.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.550
You were the first one

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.010
who found the body, right?

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.480
The officer is asking you questions.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.880
Why are you looking at me?

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.350
Cooperate with them

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.280
and tell them everything you know.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.830
I'll cooperate, definitely.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.000
Definitely.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.680
I'm just...

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.480
I'm just...

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.000
I'm just afraid.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.200
What are you afraid of?

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.550
You didn't kill anyone.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.160
I'm still traumatized.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440
After that incident,

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.320
when I got home,

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.070
I vomited for 3 days straight.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.110
Couldn't keep anything down.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.770
Everything I ate came back up.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.450
That's what you got

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.240
for going to the Bao family

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.440
and tattling.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.750
But this matter

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.030
isn't my fault either.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.960
I had no choice.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.920
My sister married into the Bao family.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.270
So I'm asking,
are you related through your sister

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.350
or directly to the Bao family?

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.240
It is

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.110
not about that.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.200
Alright, alright.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.640
Go on. Continue.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.510
Well...

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.070
I didn't want to

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.180
get involved in this matter.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.700
It's because

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:07.510
my sister and I,

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.550
when we were on our trip,

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.790
ran into Xu Qingli.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.230
Pull over.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.380
What's wrong?

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.850
Let's go to Bao's house.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.880
Bao's house?

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.700
Hurry!

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.640
I need to turn around.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.640
You're so stupid.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.160
Hop in.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.790
Let's go, come on!

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.750
Alright!

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.210
Later, we

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.000
couldn't catch up with Xu Qingli.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.720
Then,

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.270
those people from the Bao family

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.870
ended up staying at my house.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.240
They ate my food,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.200
lived in my house, and drank my drinks,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.790
and I couldn't kick out of them,
no matter what.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.480
I really had no choice.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.160
I...

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.830
Officer.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.960
What I did

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.700
is not illegal, right?

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.590
It's not illegal,

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.000
but it's not right either.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.440
It's not that I'm not right. I just...

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.500
Alright, alright.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.420
Go on. Continue.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.210
The day before

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.240
we found the body,

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.200
my brother-in-law bought some liquor,

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.000
and I drank with the Bao family members

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.240
together.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.110
In the end,

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.880
everyone passed out drunk.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.350
The next day,

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.240
just before dawn,

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.070
I felt uncomfortable

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.440
and wanted to get some fresh air outside.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.750
It was raining outside.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.000
When I opened the door,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.400
I saw a large plume of smoke

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.790
on the mountain across.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.270
I thought there was a fire,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.200
and the shock sobered me up immediately.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.000
Then I quickly went to find help.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.270
Back then, I was

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.160
the security chief of the village.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.920
The old secretary had bad legs,

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.070
so I quickly gathered

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.110
a few people to go up there.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.240
Thankfully, it was raining that day.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.000
When we got there, we found

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.200
the house had almost been

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.600
completely burned down.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.650
Only the frame was left,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.680
still smoking.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:04.960
Is the house he mentioned

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.880
the one you mentioned yesterday,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.680
the small house on the mountain?

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.070
I was puzzled at the time.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.640
That house had been vacant

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.520
for a long time.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.240
It was perfectly fine,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.510
so how could it catch fire?

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.720
Yes, when

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.110
the fire was put out,

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.310
we could go inside,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.550
and we actually

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.400
pulled out Xu Qingli.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.960
At that moment,

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.480
everyone was shocked.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.960
We just thought about
getting help quickly.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.960
We rushed to find help.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.200
When I think back now,

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.640
it was so terrifying.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.730
Afterward, I led people there.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.030
No wonder Mazai was scared.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.270
He was burned black.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.000

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.270
you would have nightmares.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.000
Yes, yes.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.270
He was burned like that.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.440
How could you be sure

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.370
it was Xu Qingli?

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.920
He left a suicide note.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.450
It was on the vest

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.680
he always wore.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.440
It was written in blood,

next to the house.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.160
It had his name on it.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.640
He wrote the Chinese character "Li"
without the hook stroke.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.750
He said the character
without the hook stroke

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.110
meant lasting success.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.110

But he wouldn't listen.
He could've chosen anyone,

In my opinion,

he ended up like this

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.720

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.550
all the pots and dishes in the house.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.960
So I comforted him, saying,

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.880
"Since the two of them

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.920
haven't come back to the village

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.360
with their tails between their legs,

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.030
it means

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.040
they can still make it in the city."

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.430
Two country folks

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.030
hardly had any education.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.670
How could it be easy

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.400
to survive in the city?

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.290
They're not mangroves

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.190
that can grow wherever they fall.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.190
Don't you agree?

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.830
Jobs with room and board are available.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.960
Not hard to find.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.590
But...

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.000
But the pay is too low.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.290
Look,

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.320
these decent jobs

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.110
with slightly better pay

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.590
all require at least
a high school diploma.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.280
What can we do then?

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.230
It's too late

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.590
to get a high school education now.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.520
You're still in the mood for jokes?

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:09.800
I'm serious.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.730
Staying here

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.190
costs 5 yuan per day.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.230
We can't keep delaying.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.510
Then let's find

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.920
some simple job first.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.880
For a simple job,

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.960
I think

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.740
the Fucheng Sugar Factory

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.760
will work.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.000
They need lots of people

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.930
and don't have many requirements.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:27.680
I heard that the sugarcanes

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.640
from our village

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.070
are all sold to them.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.280
The sugar factory?

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.000
If you can find

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.800
an easy position, that's fine.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.630
But if you're handling bagasse

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:39.550
or stirring syrup,

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.550
you might as well go back to farming.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.480
So what do you want to do?

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.940
Really go back to farming?

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.000
No.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.400
Let's keep looking.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:51.880
There must be a job

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.220
suitable for an educated person like me.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.760
"Heaven gave me talents to be put to use;

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:02.480
Though a thousand coins are spent,
more will come."

[Civilized Unit]

Baozhen.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.150
Qingli.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.350
I bought some medicine for you.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:22.420
Take it after you finish eating.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:22.800
Okay.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:24.800
Thank you, Qingli.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.040
Eat up.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.110
I ordered these steamed buns for you.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:27.440
Okay.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.230
Baozhen.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.610
I've made up my mind.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:40.400
I want to work

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:41.840
at the sugar factory too.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.560
Really?

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.080
You've thought it through?

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:47.280
Whether I like it or not,
I have to face reality.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.940
We can barely afford the rent.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:52.720
That's right. Money gives you security.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.580
We need to establish ourselves first,

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.040
then find ways to climb up.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:57.400
Qingli.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.030
Earning an honest living

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:00.560
is nothing to be ashamed of.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.400
Yes,

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.030
you're right.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.550
I'll go apply right after this.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:06.000
Good.

[Hao's Stir-Fry]

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.310
I'll still be close to you.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:11.360
It's just across the railway,

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.840
in the alcohol workshop.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.710
That's great.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.520
I've heard

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.010
the alcohol workshop offers good benefits.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.480
It's not that great,

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.340
and there's no dormitory,

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.340
so I'll still have to rent a place.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.880
I'm not really

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.030
a drinker.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.920

This is for you.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.550
Take a look.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.960
This watch

00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.860
must be expensive.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.670
It's not a fancy brand.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.830
I don't spend much money anyway,

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.360
so I managed to save a bit.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.250
You always mentioned

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.000
that your clock at home wasn't accurate.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.800
I thought when I had some money,

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.230
I'd buy you a watch.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.480
Thank you, Baozhen.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.840

we've made our dreams come true?

I noticed the factory office is hiring.

I'm thinking of applying

to change departments.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.480
I don't want to work
on the production line anymore.

That's great.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.000
Working in an office would be easier.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.750
It's not about being easier.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.030
I think this way,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.110
I'll have more time

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.710
to study and review.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.730
I want to try for higher education.

Do you remember

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.770
when we first came here?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.320
It was the same restaurant.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.450
Even the same table.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.360
Back then, we

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.150
didn't dare to order anything here.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.030
But now,

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.510
we can order whatever we want.
