You were enjoying yourself in there,
weren't you?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.640
Why be afraid now?

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.840
Are you out of your mind?

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.359
(Kids these days are insane.)

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.000
(He's too much.)

Gu Liusu!

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.719
Mo Li, you brought us treats again.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.680
I did.

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.759
So,

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:38.680
how have you been?

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.400
We're great.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.560
Studying hard?

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:41.919
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.360
Come on, let's go eat.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.120
Come on.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280
Let's go eat.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.840
Come on!

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.719
Mo Li, I found what you wanted.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:57.400
Director.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.400
This is the past 30 years
of our orphanage.

00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:02.800
I put all the photos together

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.360
into an album.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.960
Look.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.599
Look.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.800
You were so young

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.479
back then.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.159
I'm old now.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.719
No, not at all.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.159
See here?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.080
That's Liusu when she was young,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.560
Liusu?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.719
She used to have a different name.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.719
Her name had the word "Nian"

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.800
in it.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.680
Gu Nian?

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:36.680
I worried she might
cling too much to the past,

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.199
so I changed it for her.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.400
Thank you for helping

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.319
with this charity event.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.280
Director,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.400
it's something GL and Xinghan
organized together.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.355
I'm just doing my job.

00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:00.150
It's nothing, really.

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.960
Don't say that.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.840
We owe it all
to kindhearted people like you.

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.080
I thank you on Liusu's behalf too.

00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:09.360
It's fine. You don't have to thank me.

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.919
I heard you studied overseas
since you were young?

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:14.599
Yes.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.920
I joined Xinghan right after graduation.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.759
Mr. Jing called.
He said the project might fall through.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.560
Mr. Jing?

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.360
Hello?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.000
I thought we had a deal.

00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:49.800
If you short us
10,000 carats of diamonds,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.920
we'll lose half our orders this quarter.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.800
The mine is in a war zone right now.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.319
This matter is out of our hands.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.399
But I already signed the contract.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.319
We'll have to sign a new one.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.920
All right.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.920
Do you have time tonight?

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.000
Let's have dinner together.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.360
All right.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.800
6 PM

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.600
at Yisan Restaurant.

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.199
All right.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:13.959
Lu Xingchen,

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:14.950
why didn't you knock

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.244
before coming into my office?

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.560
Sorry.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.120
Don't be mad.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.509
Frowning gives you wrinkles,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.822
and it'll ruin your pretty face.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.480
Here's your coffee.

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:32.279
Get to work.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.319
Did she wake up
on the wrong side of the bed?

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.319
Don't go in. Don't provoke her.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.199
This should do it.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.879
Ms. Gu is busy.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.879
Mr. Xingchen.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.759
How's work?

00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:02.630
I need to speak with Ms. Gu.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:04.560
Hold up.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.319
I need to make a call.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.360
What is it now?

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.040
Someone unrelated
to our company is here asking for you.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.160
Do you want to meet him?

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.560
You're only a few steps away.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.680
Was a phone call necessary?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.822
If you don't, I'll send...

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.160
Mo Li, you're here.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.399
Ms. Liusu.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.560
Perfect timing. I wanted to talk to you

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.480
about the charity auction.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.759
I'd like to set up a small stage

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.279
to display the kids' drawings.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.399
And we need a backdrop

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:51.920
for the media and guests

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.319
to take photos.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.759
Actually, this whole auction

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.519
is an opportunity
Ms. Baozhu arranged for me.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.480
I feel a little uncomfortable

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.839
about that.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.680
Look.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.839
Are those two

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.720
standing too close?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.000
No.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.639
Since when has Ms. Gu
been that close with anyone?

00:07:14.244 --> 00:07:15.422
He's trying to take advantage.

00:07:15.466 --> 00:07:16.555
He's just here to hit on her.

00:07:16.577 --> 00:07:17.480
No.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.755
You're too sensitive.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.759
Xinghan has been supporting
the orphanage for years.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.879
Just treat this as work.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.600
It's not...

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.680
Ms. Liusu.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.319
Are you free this Saturday?

00:07:28.688 --> 00:07:30.390
Would you like to watch a play together?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.759
I'm sorry, Mo Li.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:38.360
I'm a bit swamped this week.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.160
Is something wrong

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.560
at GL?

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.560
Are you planning to jump ship to GL?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.920
Why do you care so much about GL?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.319
We're just checking in on each other.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.279
What are you, a saint?

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:53.160
Telling you won't solve anything.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.279
Are you speaking to me as Mr. Xingchen

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.079
right now

00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.920
or as Secretary Lu?

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:01.800
I...

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.120
Lu Xingchen.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.519
Sorry about this, Mo Li.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.079
This does concern trade secrets.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.759
You have plenty on your plate as it is.

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.959
Don't worry about us.
We've troubled you enough...

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:14.879
Gu Liusu!

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.959
I'm the one who's been helping you.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.879
Why do you always take his side?

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:21.399
Lu Xingchen, if you want to argue,
do it somewhere else.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.080
Mr. Xingchen is such a handful.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.960
I don't know if I should apologize
to you or if you should apologize to me.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.679
It's fine.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.000
I'll apologize.

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:47.879
I should get back
to work on the charity auction.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.960
I'll reach out again when you have time.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.679
I'll take my leave.

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:56.360
Goodbye.

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:03.120
That's a bit too strong.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.519
Better double-check this.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.870
Okay, I'll have another look.

00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:07.200
The data doesn't add up.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.559
Let me see that.

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.159
Where are you?

00:09:13.244 --> 00:09:14.240
None of your business.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.200
It's work hours.

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:17.440
Then dock my pay.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.519
Besides,

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:20.639
you already have Mr. Mo with you.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.919
You might as well
just make him your secretary.

00:09:25.288 --> 00:09:27.870
(Gu Liusu, your secretary ditched work!
Why are you smiling?)

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:28.919
(What's gotten into you?)

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:30.519
(My goodness...)

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:34.159
My head is about to explode.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.279
My head hurts.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.559
Xuan.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.519
I'm going to go change.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.080
Come with me
to a business dinner tonight.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.559
Got it.

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:49.879
Ms. Gu, go easy on the alcohol.

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:52.639
I can't promise that.

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:55.320
Mr. Jing suddenly shorted us
10,000 carats of diamonds.

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:58.000
I need to be ready for anything.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.050
Then let me drink for you.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.755
All right. Follow my lead.

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:05.799
And then you just left?

00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:07.488
What else could I do?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Stand there and watch them
acting all lovey-dovey?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:10.799
Not a chance.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.120
You're spineless.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.039
Why not just tell Liusu

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:16.399
you like her?

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:17.879
Who says I like her?

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:19.080
Don't be ridiculous.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.000
I only encouraged you

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.639
because I thought her concern for you

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:24.639
was more like an elder's.

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:27.799
But maybe not. Forget it.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.720
If you're not going after her,

00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:33.919
then that means I have a chance.

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:37.240
I suggest

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.720
you clear those cheesy ideas about love

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.720
from your mind.

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.519
What's Lin Xiang doing here?

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:54.039
Play it by ear.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.960
Ms. Gu, you look as stunning as ever.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.480
It has been so long.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.022
Last time, we never even had
a proper drink together.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.577
This time, we must.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.759
Mr. Jing,

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:09.320
Xinyi has always been devoted
to the diamond business.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.240
We should work more closely

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.879
from now on.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.039
If I'm not mistaken,

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.720
Xinyi mainly deals in gold.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.679
Mr. Jing,
GL is fully committed to diamonds.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.720
But business is tough these days.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.844
Liusu,

00:11:24.888 --> 00:11:26.600
a teacher can only lead you to the door.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.799
The rest is up to you.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.759
Mr. Lin,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.120
thank you for supporting GL
all these years.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.159
It's why we were able
to grow so quickly.

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:40.960
Let me drink to you.

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:45.159
I'm too old. I can't drink anymore.

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.440
(Trouble at tonight's dinner.
Requesting backup.)
