Xiaojun said

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.730
you're from Jialin.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.830
There aren't

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.000
many people in Nanyang,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.070
so it's quite by destiny that you could

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.950
meet in Weihai.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.310
It really is.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.480
I never expected

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.740
it would be so amazing.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.140
The first time I saw you,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.470
I felt a connection.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.290
And when you spoke to me,

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.020
hearing our hometown dialect,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.760
it really gave me

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.750
that feeling of

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.830
familiarity.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.510
That's nonsense.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.150
The first time

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.870
I talked to him,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.190
he completely ignored me.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.190
Not at all.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.270
I'm just the type

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.800
who doesn't like talking

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.510
to people I don't know well.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.130
Mr. Ni,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.690
how did you get that scar

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.630
on your face?

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.680
When I was a kid,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.240
my dad was tending a fire.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.200
I was being naughty,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.810
ran over to mess around,

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.050
and got burned.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.520
Back then in the village,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.260
we didn't have much medicine,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.270
so it left

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.000
this big scar.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.120
Does it look bad?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.750
Not at all.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.320
When I was young, the elders used to say

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.970
that eyebrow area represents brotherhood.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.900
I don't really know what it means.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.470
Xiaojun, do you know?

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.560
Isn't it that

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.750
if your eyebrows are injured,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.240
it will harm your brothers?

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.560
Isn't that what it means?

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.820
The brotherhood area.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.680
Is that so?

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.120
I don't think it's a brotherhood area.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.190
It's more like a marriage area.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.480
At my age,

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.980
I don't even have a wife.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.080
I don't think it's ugly.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.560
It's very masculine.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.159
Brother,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.700
come on,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:49.390
cheers.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.330
Cheers.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.510
Xiaojun,

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.830
let's toast to Mr. Ni.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.390
To you.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.830
No, no. I should toast to you.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.800
To...

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:57.970
To destiny.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.980
Thank you both.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.630
I'm very happy.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.480
Are you a fool?

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.560
What were you thinking,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.360
bringing a stranger to our home?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.800
He has nowhere to stay now.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.010
Besides,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.630
he's helped us before.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.240
That's not how you repay someone.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.320
What did he do before?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.980
Do we know anything about him?

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.720
How dare you?

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.360
It's just for a few days.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.750
Tomorrow you need to tell him

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.540
that this is our situation

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.360
and he can't stay long.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.910
Keep your voice down.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.910
He's gone?

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.510
This money was left by him?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.120
Xiaojun.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.510
You're up?

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.550
You were staying here just fine.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.080
Why did you suddenly leave?

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.550
This morning,

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.080
a friend

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.340
introduced me to a job.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:31.950
The boss was pushing hard

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.150
and wanted me to report immediately.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.750
When I left,

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.670
you weren't up yet,

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.870
so I didn't wake you.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.370
Don't worry.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.900
The job is good.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.630
Meals and accommodation included.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.090
Really.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.270
I won't trouble you anymore.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.270
Come back.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.190
Really, don't worry about me.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:49.790
I'll remember your kindness to me

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.840
in my heart.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.240
Let me make some money first.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.700
When I earn enough,
I'll come back to see you.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.080
Aren't we brothers?

00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.720
Yes,

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.720
of course we are.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.940
Good brothers.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.200
Since we are brothers,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.360
don't lie to me.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:05.720
Tell me,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.610
where are you really staying now?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:10.820
Xiangdong,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.480
if you don't want to stay here,

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.320
I can take you to a place

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.780
where you can settle down.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.670
The winter here is not like Nanyang.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:18.960
You could freeze to death

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.420
without a place to live in.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.360
Well,

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.840
alright.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.080
What about my job then?

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.440
Nagging.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.510
I'll wait for you at home.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.080
Hurry up.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.600
Okay.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.150
This way.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.750
Come in.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.270
Ocean view.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.320
Three bedrooms and one living room.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.390
Good ventilation.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.910
The only drawback

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.910
is there's no water or electricity.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.030
Let me tell you,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.120
about this place,

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:39.800
before,

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.790
I was working at a recycling station,

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:42.440
and then

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.630
it was demolished.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.250
So I collected some old furniture

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.750
and took over this place.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.750
Thought it might be useful someday.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.080
There's no security around here.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.150
If you need water,

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.990
go east.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.630
There's a public toilet
about 300 meters away.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.670
When nobody's there,

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.670
you can get some water.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.750
If someone's there,

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.240
you can give him 1 yuan.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:02.960
That'll do.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.550
Another thing is

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.870
the windows.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.610
I've sealed them all

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.790
with this plastic sheeting.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:09.450
But I think

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.240
you should still get some

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.240
firewood.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.720
There's some over there.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.810
After you light it,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.400
it won't be so cold at night.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.770
Daytime is fine though.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.790
Xiaojun.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.040
What else do you need?

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.600
Since I left Nanyang until now,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.600
this is the first time I've met

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.060
such kind people like you.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.150
Thank you.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.720
Brothers look out for each other.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.720
You said that.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.870
This one has peanut and sesame filling.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.440
It's still not as good as

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.320
the coconut filling back home.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.910
Sun told me,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.030
Wang Cheng from the construction site,

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.790
that boss,

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.280
got arrested again.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.030
The wages are gone again.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.540
It's okay.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.600
That place in Yongshuo is not bad.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.120
If we can't afford the rent,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.360
we can move there.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.450
Let's drink.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:20.720
Cheers.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.920
We should be happy during the festival.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.240
Forget about that.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.320
Let's be happy.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.500
Xiangdong,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.600
can you drive?

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:39.960
What's up?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.100
No, I can't.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.670
I found a moving job.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.240
Paid daily.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.060
We need one more person.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.550
Want to join?

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.200
Sure.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.840
Great.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.030
We'll work with them

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.000
for a while,

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.700
continuously for ten days or half a month.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:01.800
Let's figure out

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.720
how the moving business works.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.510
Then we can save money

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.470
to buy a used truck

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.000
and start our own business.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.970
I've already thought of a name.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.890
It'll be called

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.390
Brothers Moving.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.000
How about that?

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.790
Sounds good.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.600
Brothers Moving.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.080
Where are Tianbao and Ximei?

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.200
Tianbao, come out!

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.240
Happy birthday to you.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.390
Happy birthday to you.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.120
Happy birthday to you.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:03.750
Happy birthday to you.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.630
Uncle Ni, happy birthday.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.560
Xiangdong, happy birthday.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.750
Happy birthday.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.010
What's all this?

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.480
You told me before.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.320
I remember.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.060
Tianbao told us,

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.320
so I know

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:38.550
your birthday

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.360
is on the Lantern Festival.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.260
So today we

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.870
want to celebrate with you.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.150
Thank you.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.870
Thank you all.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.270
Thanks.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.370
What's next?

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.000
Make a wish. Now.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.150
Make a wish now.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.960
Make a wish.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.720
Make a wish.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.680
What wish should I make?

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.750
I wish we...

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.720
You can't say it out loud,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.160
or it won't come true.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.110
Uncle Ni,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.400
why are you crying?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.030
Who's crying?

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:55.550
You're mistaken.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.480
I wish we...

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.790
Xiaojun.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.290
Xiaojun, what's wrong?

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.110
Xiaojun.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.550
Why are you here?

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.270
You're hurt?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.980
Where are you hurt?

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.110
Where?

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:25.960
Let me see.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.590
I'm fine.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.510
I'm okay.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.670
Why are you here?

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.210
It's nothing.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.720
You called me

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.790
but you didn't say anything.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:34.510
I was worried about you,

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.440
so I came over.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.890
What are you looking for?

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.690
What's wrong?

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:53.720
My phone.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.940
I think I lost my phone.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.050
Wasn't it you who called me?

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.730
That person isn't dead?

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.550
Is he dead or not?

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.310
That's impossible.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.130
It's clearly...

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.270
Ximei.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.890
It's not safe here anymore.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.320
We need to leave quickly.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.740
How's it going with the insurance?

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.000
Missing for less than 4 years

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.730
can't get a death certificate.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.810
The insurance company

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.420
says it doesn't meet
the compensation conditions.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:14.710
What should we do?

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.560
What should we do, Xiaojun?

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.630
What if...

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.800
What if the police find out?

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.100
Let's run away.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.130
Let's go somewhere else first.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.610
Our lives are at stake.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:49.030
We can run,

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.960
but what about Tianbao's illness?

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.550
Jiaonan.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.330
Let's go to Jiaonan.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:05.240
In Jiaonan,

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.970
there should be a way
to cure Tianbao's illness.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.950
I've told you before.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.990
Even if I have to sell my blood or organs,

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.680
I'll save Tianbao's life.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.420
Let's leave Weihai first.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.350
Early tomorrow morning,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.810
I'll go find the boat boss.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.270
I'm so tired, Xiaojun.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.640
I don't want to keep running anymore.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.970
When will this end?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.970
Don't be afraid, Ximei.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.200
No matter what happens,

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.590
I'll always be with you.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.880
I'll stay by your side.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.640
How did we end up like this?

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.500
How did we

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.550
come to this?

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.960
[Fortune]

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.750
Coming.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:22.960
Ximei.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.240
You don't need

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.300
to bring anything.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:26.110
It's so hot today,

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.160
and I have to trouble you.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:27.620
Ximei.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.680
Give it to me.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:29.720
Ms. Li.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.160
Give it to me.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:30.880
Ximei, do you have any vinegar?

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.650
Where's Tianbao?

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.500
Yes, I do.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.260
Tianbao,

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.840
did you miss me?

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.070
Here you go.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.790
I'll return it to you tomorrow.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.190
It's fine. It's nothing.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.310
Thank you.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:40.930
Xiaojun.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.880
Ni's already here.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.480
-What is this?
-You're here.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.480
Tianbao,

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.810
you asked for things from Uncle Ni again.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.510
I said I would treat you.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.590
Eating at your place is one thing,

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.270
but you've bought so many things.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.480
You always buy toys for Tianbao,

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.960
and snacks.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.000
We just bought some food and drinks.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.880
What's wrong with that?

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.550
Besides, you like this wine too.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.310
I'm willing.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.160
Okay?

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.090
-Have a seat.
-Sit.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.790
I'll go make dinner.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:03.440
Okay.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.920
Which one do you like?

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.820
I like this one.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.790
Do you remember

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.270
the boss of that moving company

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.800
when we first started moving business?

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.010
Mr. Wang?

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.630
What? Are you still in touch?

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.430
No.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.850
I just saw their moving truck today.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.490
Hu was still driving.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.030
I just chatted with him briefly.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.240
Hu told me that...

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.590
Mr. Wang's nephew died.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.030
Died?

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.240
Yes.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.840
Tianbao,

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.780
go play by yourself inside, okay?

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.270
Tianbao.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.360
Give me a kiss.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.070
How did he die?

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.030
I still remember

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.350
his nephew's nickname,

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.200
Lei.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.160
Lei.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.350
He was quite tall

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880
with yellow hair.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.640
He drove a small car,

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.920
revving the engine all day,

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920
always racing.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.960
Nearly knocked me down once.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.240
Yeah.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:02.550
He just

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.920
crashed while racing,

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.550
hitting a truck carrying steel bars.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.400
From his chest to his back,

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.230
he was completely
impaled by the steel bar.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.480
A hole this big.

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.160
Terrible.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.680
The morning of the day
he had the accident,

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:22.890
Lei took his cousin

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.200
to that tattoo parlor,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.510
and it happened that evening.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.270
You know why?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.560
He got a tattoo of
something he shouldn't have.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.830
He tattooed Guangong.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.440
Guangong.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.970
You know where

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.070
his wound was?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Right on Guangong's head.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.460
Isn't that creepy?

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.630
It's just superstition, of course.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:00.690
Let's not talk about it anymore.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.000
Respect the dead.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.440
Cheers.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.030
Therefore,

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.310
when we drive in the future,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.640
we must pay attention to safety.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.410
Speaking of Guangong,

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.610
I remember something.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.820
Do you want to hear it?

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.950
Tell me.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
It's also creepy.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.030
Many years ago,

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.960
one night

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.070
in the forest,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.920
there was a man

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:46.370
and a woman.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.400
What were they doing?

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.270
That man and woman

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.880
were digging a hole.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.740
Digging a hole?

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.240
Do you know what

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.170
they were doing?

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.920
What?

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.960
Burying the body.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:22.970
You know,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.110
why I thought of Guangong

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.510
when telling this story?

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.760
The man who was burying the body

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.920
had a tattoo

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:37.860
of Guangong on his back.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.130
Back then,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.510
didn't those gangsters

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.480
all

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.070
copy those triad members and get tattoos?

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.510
Either Guangong or dragons.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.110
Seven or eight out of ten

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.310
would get Guangong tattoos.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.510
No,

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.070
his Guangong tattoo

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.000
wasn't an ordinary one.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.640
He had a tattoo of Guangong
with open eyes.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:05.960
Do you know

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.020
what a Guangong with open eyes means?

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:12.440
I don't know if you believe this or not,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.260
but as the saying goes,

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.760
once Guangong

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.680
open his eyes,

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.010
blood will be spilled.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.960
I scared you!

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.030
And then?

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.640
Then...

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.830
I don't know.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.240
Later that friend got drunk.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.550
He was drunk?

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.200
Yes.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.480
Why didn't that man call the police?

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.700
He was making it up.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.110
I think he was too drunk.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.800
In the middle of the night

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.590
and in the wilderness,

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.920
you can't see anything.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.960
How could he see any Guangong tattoo?

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.480
Finish this drink,

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.700
then go back and rest.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.440

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:25.790
Yes.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
No.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.010
How would I know him?

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.110
We were having dinner,

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.400
and a friend brought him along.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.720
I heard him talking there.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.400
He was drunk and rambling.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.650
Take it easy.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.880

It was too chaotic at that time.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.840
No.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:36.440
I didn't notice.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:37.480
When I was cleaning up,

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.739
I didn't see it either.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.920
Do you think...

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920
It's impossible.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.360
When you first asked him,

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:01.920
did you notice

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.520
anything strange about him?

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.440
Yes.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.440
When I asked him...

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.280
I asked him

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:12.280
where his hometown is.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.740
He said it's Mang Village.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:14.510
But then he said

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:15.880
he grew up in the city

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.710
and didn't know about the village.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.970
He didn't even know
his generation name.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.480
The birthday he told Tianbao

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.490
isn't Ni Xiangdong's.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.400
That should be

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.760
his own birthday.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.800
But if he saw it,

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.700
how could he...

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.360
How could he act like nothing happened?

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.670
And that scar of his,

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:48.480
why

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.170
is it in exactly the same place

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.520
as Ni Xiangdong's scar?

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.030
How can it be such a coincidence?

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.050
Could something be wrong?

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.840
Let's go ask him.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.180
How can we ask about something like this?

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.110
Come on, birthday boy.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.280
Tianbao.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.510
Uncle Ni.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.920
Happy birthday,

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.760
-Tianbao.
-Thank you, Uncle Ni.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.320
Happy birthday.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.000
Look.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.510
I brought a gift to you.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.440
-A schoolbag.
-Thank you, Uncle Ni.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:48.110
Do you like it?

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.030
I'm the Monkey King. I like it.

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:51.510
Let me put it away for you.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.070
Tianbao was just talking about you,

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.070
guessing your zodiac sign.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.500
He said Uncle Ni

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.030
must be born in the Year of the Monkey,
just like him.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.250
Right.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:36:59.780
Tianbao,

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.850
ask your Uncle Ni

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.000
what his zodiac sign is.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.530
Uncle Ni,

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.030
what's your zodiac sign?

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.670
Mine is...

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.080
the Horse.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.360
If you were born
in the Year of the Monkey like me,

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.000
that would be great.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.600
We'd be just like Sun Wukong.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.580
Right.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.760
Sun Wukong can do 72 transformations.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.760
Uncle Ni,

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.280
if you could do 72 transformations,

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.010
what would you transform into?

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.450
If I could do 72 transformations,

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.630
I'd definitely transform into Sun Wukong.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:29.610
Wouldn't there be two

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:30.610
Sun Wukongs then?

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:31.360
No,

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.310
there's only one Sun Wukong.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.960
The other one would be

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.760
the Six-Eared Macaque.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.670
He doesn't understand
what you're talking about.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:40.030
Come on.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.490
Come on.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.280
Blow out the candles.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:41.940
Make a wish.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:43.880
Come on.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.280
Happy birthday to you.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:52.400
Happy birthday to you.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:57.150
Happy birthday to you.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.880
Happy birthday to you.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.960
Great!

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.910
Let mommy give you a kiss.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.230
Happy birthday.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.150
Turn on the light.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.000
Tianbao.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:12.760
I want to have some cake.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.480
Study hard,

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.880
and make progress every day.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.880
Cutting a big piece.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.190
Smaller.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.890
Have you forgotten what the doctor said?

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.450
Is this enough?

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.230
Here.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.630
Here.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:31.440
Ximei,

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.840
I'm not drinking anymore.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.240
I got drunk the other day.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.840
What are you afraid of? We're family.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.700
Just one drink.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:38.400
Okay.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:38.960
One drink.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.690
Cao Tianbao.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.510
Didn't we agree

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.800
to celebrate your birthday at my house?

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.590
Alright, thank you.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.030
I'll show you my new doll.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.710
I haven't eaten yet.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.280
You eat first.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.940
My grandma steamed some bass.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.760
It's okay, Tianbao,

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.800
go have some bass.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.880
Lele, have a piece of cake.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.670
Yes.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.400
Take a piece of cake with you.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.530
-Thank you.
-Here's for your grandma.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.110
Right.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.760
Tianbao, help Lele take it.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.320
Okay.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.690
-Stand there.
-Here, take the cake.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:03.520
Good boy.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.230
I will pick you up later.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:08.800
Tianbao always wants to play with Lele

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.280
after school every day.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.890
Well, he and Lele

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:13.510
make a good match.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.800
Yes.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:16.550
Ni,

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.560
in which year did you leave Jialin?

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.880
I left

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:23.840
in 2004.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:25.670
What a coincidence.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.280
What about you?

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.880
We also left in 2004.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.400
Yes.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.210
Yes, the year Tianbao was born.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.590
What a coincidence.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:32.630
Yeah.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.460
Xiangdong,

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.320
I remember you mentioned

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.030
that

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:37.920
the scar on your face

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.710
was from a burn when you were a kid.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.840
But I noticed there's no scar

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.040
on your ID card photo.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.620
When did you

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:01.760
ever see my ID card?

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:04.800
Why so nervous?

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.710
I'm not.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:06.890
That day

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.280
when we were getting
our driver's licenses,

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.110
you went to the toilet

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:10.920
and I took your ID card for you.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.960
Is it hard to say?

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.630
No.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.280
Look at you.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.400
I'm just curious.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.760
Xiaojun,

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:35.230
Ximei,

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.360
actually, there's something

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.440
I haven't told you.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.360
That ID card you saw

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.160
isn't actually mine.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.960
Whose is it then?

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:56.440
I don't know.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.150
I bought it.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.800
Bought it?

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.710
Back then,

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.560
I got into some trouble,

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.610
and I found someone

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:10.240
who had

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.760
many fake ID cards.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.070
I spent 50 yuan

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.920
to buy one.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.200
Now that I've told you this.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:31.400
I have nothing

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.800
to hide from you anymore.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.760
You've been so good to me.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.070
So I'll tell you everything.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.330
My surname isn't actually Ni.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.010
My surname is

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.510
Yu,

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.810
and I'm from Yafen Village.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:55.760
At the end of 2003,

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.880
I got into a conflict
with someone back home

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.150
and accidentally stabbed him.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.800
After that, I just kept running,

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.800
hiding everywhere,

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:08.710
wandering around,

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:10.370
until I finally ended up here.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.120
I originally had

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.280
no hope for my life.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.440
I just thought

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.400
someday the police would arrest me.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.400
I'd get sentenced

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.440
and go to prison.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.120
I wasn't afraid.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.480
But then I met you...

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.480
And you gave me

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.130
a feeling like home again.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.960
That's when I decided

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:36.230
to stay here

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.030
and settle down.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.030
Ni.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:47.240
Look,

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.070
we don't mean anything else.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.760
Right.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:50.550
Yes.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.800
I just want to tell you.

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:57.270
I don't want to hide it from you anymore.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.290
I really wasn't

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.480
keeping it from you on purpose.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.810
How am I supposed to tell

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.560
this kind of thing to anyone?

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.480
Anyway, now

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.010
I've told you everything.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:07.440
It's your own

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:08.590
choice to make.
