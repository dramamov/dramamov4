Xiaosheng?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.680
The Village Chief took my mother away.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.920
Let's go.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.200
Mother.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.840
Mother.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.000
Your death was far too tragic.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.960
Don't cry.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.280
(Just as I thought.)

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.800
(It was all arranged beforehand.)

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.000
(They were waiting for me.)

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.840
He Qingqing.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.480
You caused Mother's death.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.420
You still dare show up?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.520
Datian.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.760
What matters most now

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880
is to calm your mother's spirit

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.920
to bring peace to our village.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.240
Afterwards,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.360
I will see justice served for you.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.000
We'll follow you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.160
and Taoist's lead.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.600
By the decree of the heavens...

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.000
She… she really is

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.240
the reincarnation of the Widow Star.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.600
The Widow Star harms both mother and kin.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.360
It will bring great disaster

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.840
upon the entire village.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.680
Taoist,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.560
what should we do now?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240
Keeping vigil alone

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.040
won't calm the wrath of Heaven.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.200
Only by cutting flesh to repay her mother

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.440
can the crisis be resolved.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.040
Qingqing,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.680
for the sake of the village,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.560
this is the only way.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.360
Utterly ignorant.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.240
Guards!

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.160
What are you doing? Let go!

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.380
- Trying to run?
- Kneel!

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.280
- Let go!
- Trying to flee?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.240
Stop!

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.360
Qingqing.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.240
Village Chief,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.280
this is suspicious.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.520
Look.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.000
This stone fell from the archway.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.800
The break is perfectly even.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.640
How could it be struck by lightning?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.640
Who says a lightning-struck stone

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.520
must always be jagged?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.360
Exactly.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.320
Not so.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.720
Not so, not so.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.200
According to the...

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.840
the county gazetteer,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.360
since ancient times,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.520
our village has seen nearly
100 lightning strikes.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
As recorded in the books,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.900
some, as fierce as heaven-shaking bolts,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.100
even melt away metals

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.400
where the lightning lands.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.220
Others are as small as a few flashes...

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.140
Speak plainly.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.500
Alright then.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.100
It means

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.500
stone pieces broken by lightning

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.340
always show a blackened surface.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.420
So this archway wasn't struck
by lightning,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.020
but by human hands.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.580
What do you mean?

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.060
Village Chief,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.420
look for yourself.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.780
Alright, alright.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.700
Alright.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.820
Village Chief,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.940
now you see what's really going on.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.820
Someone was behind this.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.180
They deliberately destroyed the archway

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.940
and tried to pin the blame on me.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.780
I can handle being wronged.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.820
But doing this right under your nose,

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.940
such brazen behavior.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.540
It's a clear sign
they hold no respect for you.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.740
Village Chief,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.300
even if this incident

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.780
has nothing to do with He Qingqing,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.580
my mother-in-law's final letter is real.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.860
She always held you
in the highest regard.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.380
Year after year, answering your call

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.420
and donating valuables.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.820
Now she died
because of this spiteful woman.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.940
Village Chief,
you must stand up for her.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.900
Village Chief.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.620
On my mother's behalf,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.020
let me teach you a lesson.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.340
It hurts.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.220
It's killing me.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.060
Sorry, I'm late.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.620
Go prepare a few things for me.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.540
Especially...

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.260
iodine solution.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.340
Since they're planning

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.020
to use the final letter to set me up.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.380
Then I'll play along with their scheme.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.060
Since you just said

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.580
Mother wrote in the final letter,

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.740
accusing me of being unfilial.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.420
But I haven't even read it properly.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.820
How can I willingly admit guilt?

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.620
Very well.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.900
Then I'll let you see it clearly

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.460
and leave with no doubts.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.060
Look!

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.980
There! A spirit!

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.940
A spirit is writing!

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.980
Datian, Xifeng,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.180
I'm still worried about you

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.980
even though I'm down below.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.740
I hope you will join me
in the burial sacrifice

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.020
to ease the longing in my heart

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.540
and fulfill your duty of filial piety.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.180
Burial... Burial sacrifice...

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.420
Village Chief,

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.940
though I'm unwilling to
cut flesh to repay Mother,

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.200
she clearly stated that she wants

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.820
the two of them for burial sacrifice.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.620
I fear if only I cut my flesh now,

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.420
her wish would still not be fulfilled.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.620
Taoist,

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.340
what happens if one shows
disrespect to spirits?

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.540
It will...

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.140
It will bring great misfortune.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.060
Do as the letter instructs.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.660
What should we do, Xifeng?

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.820
You...

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.740
You swallowed Mother's final letter.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.020
What final letter?

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.340
I didn't see anything.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.220
Trying to harm me, are you?

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.260
- No chance.
- No chance.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.340
Datian, hurry!

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.340
Go, go, go!

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.180
Come on, my dear.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.700
He Qingqing.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.100
Still trying to harm me?

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.140
Not a chance.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.340
I'm clever, you know.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.580
Yes, you are.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.220
What's... happening?

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.460
Something's grabbing my foot.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.420
Datian.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.660
What is it?

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.700
Unfilial son, unfilial daughter-in-law.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.900
I'll have you join me
in burial sacrifice.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.220
Why do you defy my words?

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.540
Unfilial son, unfilial daughter-in-law.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.740
I'll have you join me in burial sacrifice.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.700
Why do you defy my words?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.100
Mother...

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.220
It's Mrs. He.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.060
Her spirit has appeared.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.020
Worthless fools.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.200
You dare to run again?

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.100
He Qingqing, stop pretending
to summon spirits.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:55.860
Xifeng.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.580
You two have committed endless wrongs

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.460
and never mend your ways.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.140
Living in this world,
you're still a blight.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.620
Hurry up now

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.300
and come along with me.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.260
Mother, I was wrong.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.700
We will change.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.820
I'll burn lots of

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.180
spirit money for you every day.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.980
Please spare me and Xifeng.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.660
Where did you go wrong?

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.260
We...

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.060
Our mistake was forging
the final fetter.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.180
We should never have

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.260
framed our sister.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.420
- Honey.
- My belly.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.860
My child...

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:28.700
My dear.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.740
What's happening to me?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.220
Your mother just possessed you.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.140
Do you feel any discomfort?

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.020
No, I don't.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.340
Village Chief,

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.500
the truth is now clear.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.340
The unfilial ones are
He Datian and Tian Xifeng.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.900
The final letter was forged.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.420
My wife...

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.580
nearly suffered a great injustice.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.540
He Datian.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.340
How could you act in such a way?

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.240
Strike their names from the clan registry.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.780
Village Chief,

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.300
we swear we'll never do it again.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.260
For the sake of all the times,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.620
I've shown you respect...

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.780
Enough.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.220
You didn't cause any grave trouble.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.980
You'll just pay

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.700
to get the village's archway repaired.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.060
Village Chief.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.820
You're letting them off so lightly?

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.260
What's wrong, my dear?

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.380
Village Chief, my wife...

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.700
Quick, fetch a physician.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.420
Hurry!

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.960
Xifeng, let's get a physician.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.380
Sorry, I came too late.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.820
You've suffered so much.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.700
It's not your fault.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.960
It was my own idea from the start.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.100
Are you alright?

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.700
It will be fine.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.140
Oh, right.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.850
You could sneak into He Datian's home

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.180
and without anyone noticing,

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.740
you tampered with the final letter.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.980
How did you pull that off?

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.100
Thanks to the days in the bandit den,

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.540
I picked up some combat skills.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.300
(Why would the bandits)

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.580
(teach a scholar martial arts?)

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.620
(And if he mastered such skills,)

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.620
(how could he have been trapped there)

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.500
(all these years?)

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.140
Fu Qinghuai,

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.900
who are you, truly?

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.420
(Next Episode)
I made this myself.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.620
For the taste,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.700
it's lacking something.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.340
But still far better than my cooking.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.300
Tangbao is a girl,

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.740
born with a knack for cooking.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.980
Work is only about whether you enjoy it

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.920
or you're good at it.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.460
It doesn't depend on gender.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.020
At the Ancestral Hall,

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.400
I saw Fu Qinghuai's skill.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.990
He hardly looked like a man of letters.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.060
Excuse me, do you know this guy?

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.940
The one with the surname Fu.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.220
Something's off about him.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.980
(Notice: Bandits In Town)
Living on the edge.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:44.980
Fu Qinghuai,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.060
who exactly are you?

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.120
