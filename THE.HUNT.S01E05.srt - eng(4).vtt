as you probably guessed,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.660
I dumped Ni Xiangdong

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.530
and got together with Xiaojun.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.160
Xiaojun is a good man.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.710
He does a lot but says little.

That's all.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.310
Why did you come to Weihai?

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.130
After Tianbao was born,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.750
we headed north,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.940

We took everything.

First, it was

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.790
to pay for Tianbao's treatment,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.519
using money to save his life.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.490
Another reason was

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.690
to avoid having any

to start school.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.720
And the hospitals here

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.159
could treat Tianbao's condition,

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.190

mentioned anything
about what happened before.

Xiaojun saw he wasn't
bringing up the past,

He cornered me
at the place where I was doing cleaning,

aren't you close with Dong?

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.930
Maybe one day he'll come to you.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.090
You could catch him

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.960
and turn him in to the police station.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.030
And you'd be worry-free

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.440
for the rest of your life.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.480
Do you have any alcohol inside?

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.800
What's wrong, brother?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.590
Nothing.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.720
Well,

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.970
I have something to do tonight.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.950
I, uh,

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.390
haven't delivered the vegetables

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.190
yet.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.740
They need them urgently.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.790
You need to deliver vegetables?

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.140
I was hoping to have a drink with you.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.200
We already agreed.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.020
Let's drink when I get back.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.440
Alright,

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.270
another day then.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.150
You go ahead with your business.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.510
Okay.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.030
I'm leaving.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.830
Okay, Danian.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.030
Bye, old brother.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.790
Let's drink next time.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.360
Okay.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.270
It's only the second day.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.940
Looks like the case
is about to be solved, Mentor.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.380
What? Solved?

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.890
Don't you think something's wrong?

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.670
Her attitude is not right.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.320
This morning she was very negative.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.440
With us, she was always

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.790
in a resistant state, right?

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.440
Now she's spilled everything at once.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.620
She didn't say it at home,

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.360
maybe afraid Tianbao would hear.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.030
But now we have real evidence.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.590
This isn't so simple.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.910
The things she said
were too many and too important.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.790
Everything is stuck
at the most critical point.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:50.590
It feels fake.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.620
Let me tell you,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.980
this kind of lie

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.960
is the hardest to detect.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.320
This case is clearly

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.180
heading toward a crime of passion.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.960
Ni Xiangdong came back to find her,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.340
then their old feelings rekindled,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.600
and he asked to get back together.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.840
Then he directed his anger at Cao Xiaojun

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.500
and killed him in a fit of rage.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.390
She's keeping herself
completely clean of it.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.440
Whether morally

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.320
or legally,

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.410
it's all their business,

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.670
nothing to do with her.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.020
She's portraying herself as

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.580
a perfect victim.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.910
Use your brain at work.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.410
Hurry back to the station.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.300
Hao!

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.480
Mom.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.080
Why are you here?

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.160
Why can't I come?

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.600
Is there any problem for me to see my son?

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.150
No problem.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.330
Why are you wearing so little?

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.330
You might catch a cold.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.800
No, I'm fine.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.620
I'm accompanying your father
to visit some old comrades.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.270
We'll leave tomorrow

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.190
and won't disturb your work.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:54.620
Okay.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.500
You must be Meng.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.030
Ma'am.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:57.750
Hello.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.120
My son talks about you all the time.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.030
You've always been

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.320
a good role model for him.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.250
Hao is great too.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.240
Really?

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.340
He's hardworking

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.480
and good police material.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.720
He's impatient.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.120
He must cause you a lot of trouble.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.840
No, not at all.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.510
It's my duty.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.670
What duty?

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.200
Young men

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.360
are hard to manage.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.780
Please take extra care

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.180
and look after him.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.940
Please don't worry.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.110
Oh, right.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.310
Wait.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.270
Wait.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.440
I brought you some buns.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.860
I just made these buns.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.910
I made them myself.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:32.960
He's loved these since he was little.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.890
-Really?
-He loves eating my buns.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.890
They're still warm.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:36.870
Share some with your Mentor later.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.150
Okay.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.150
Did you hear that?

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.190
Wait a moment.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.820
Alright, I'm leaving now.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.060
I'm leaving.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.080
Here.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.770
Take this medicine.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.790
If you sneeze or anything,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.050
take it as prevention.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.280
-Okay.
-You hear me?

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.310
Are you crying?

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.340
I'm not crying.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.410
It's just the wind.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.450
Alright, go on. It's fine.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.130
Tell Dad not to drink too much.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.260
Take care of yourself.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.450
I'll be fine.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.580
Did you hear me?

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.080
I'm leaving.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.440
Alright.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.970
You're not wearing enough.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.260
Both of you are not wearing enough!

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.390
Put on more clothes!

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.900
Bye.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:20.780
I'm a grown man now.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.720
Still bringing food and medicine to me.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.290
All parents are like this.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.040
It's good.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:31.510
[Police]

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.230
Is it?

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.370
Is your mom's cooking not so good?

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.830
Never had the chance to taste it.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.300
[Police]

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:42.960
Captain Ma.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.960
The result is out.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.510
That half of the ear

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.360
matches Cao Xiaojun's DNA.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:46.690
Okay.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.220
Besides,

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.440
we received a memory card

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.570
with photos inside.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.620
Except him,

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.760
there was another person at the scene.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.470
Where did this memory card

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.750
come from? Any fingerprints?

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.080
[Wu Ximei]

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.910
Still comparing.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:00.440
The envelope

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.700
was found at Wu Ximei's

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.600
neighbor's place.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.270
No fingerprints on the memory card.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:04.870
The envelope

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.480
only had Wu Ximei's name on it.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.240
I think it was delivered personally.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.690
I guess the photographer

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.550
wanted to deliver this

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.510
to Wu Ximei,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.000
but got the address wrong

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.720
and delivered it to her neighbor.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.030
Then the neighbor called the police.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.960
After going around in circles,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.020
it ended up with us.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.840
The handwriting was deliberately disguised

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.770
so Wu Ximei wouldn't recognize it.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.720
That means the person who took the photo

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.380
is close to Wu Ximei's family.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.220
What does he want to do?

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.750
Blackmail her?

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.810
Or report to the police?

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.500
Why didn't he come directly to us?

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.200
Afraid of retaliation?

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.380
This photo is strange too.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.380
Wang, zoom in on his eyes.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.550
But look,

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.900
look at him.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.480
He didn't seem to realize someone

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.340
was secretly taking his picture.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.430
And the person taking the photo,

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.200
Did this person bump into him?

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:55.870
Was it by chance?

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.320
Or

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.670
was it planned?

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.630
Could Ni Xiangdong

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.510
have an accomplice?

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.080
Something happened

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.080
and turned them against each other?

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.630
Whatever the case,

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.520
these are all clues.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.790
Since someone has already photographed

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.450
Ni Xiangdong dumping the body

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.440
at Mount Fufeng,

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.510
our main focus now

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.610
for investigation

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.960
is this Ni Xiangdong.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.290
Gengsheng, take down this number.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:22.900
138-

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.690
138-

Don't be nervous.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:17.880
Okay.

Why did you call Wu Ximei?

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.780
Look,

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.920
you called twice,

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.670
back to back.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.210
Think before you speak.

Don't be nervous.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.480
It's alright.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.160
This call was made by Ni Xiangdong, right?

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.550
When we notified you this morning,

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.750
why didn't you tell us?

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.240
What you did

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.200
could get others killed.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.260
Do you understand?

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.020
Can't you speak properly?

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.550
Young people are so impulsive.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.410
Don't mind him.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.240
What did Ni Xiangdong say when he came?

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.790
Not much.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.400
He just called Wu Ximei

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.200
and asked me if Xiaojun

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.930
had been in any trouble lately.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.940
How would I know?

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.210
Besides Cao Xiaojun's matter,

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.850
what else did he say?

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.080
I told Dong

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.200
something before.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.920
My nephew took a waterproofing job

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.960
for a bookstore owner.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.310
My nephew told me

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.680
that the bookstore owner's wife

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.160
has an accent
that sounds like she's from Nanyang.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.440
Her age and height

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.970
are similar to

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.130
the fellow villager he's looking for.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.110
Which bookstore?

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.150
Do you remember the address?

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.490
It's on Zhongshan Road,

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.880
called Rainbow Bookstore.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.560
So what about Ni Xiangdong?

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.680
After I took your call,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.640
he left.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.000
Does he have any

00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.700
relatives or friends

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.060
here in Weihai?

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:01.830
I mean,

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.440
does he have

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.590
a place to stay?

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.870
I really don't know, honestly.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.490
Wait.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.200
Sun Chuanhai,

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.370
when we called you,

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.100
Ni Xiangdong was there, right?

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:11.560
Yes.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.850
Why didn't you tell us?

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:15.920
I thought

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.740
there was a problem with the car.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.210
Dong's car

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.510
is registered under my name.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.920
I was afraid if there was an accident,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.070
it would cause me trouble.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.200
That's why I didn't tell you.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.640
If you're afraid of trouble,

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.270
then why did you

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.130
register his car under your name?

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.160
I just wanted to repay his kindness.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.400
Sit down.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.790
Don't be so agitated.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.000
Repay kindness?

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.930
What kindness?

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.350
My son, Sun Xiaofei,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:49.680
worked with Dong

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.080
and Xiaojun at the same construction site.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.270
Later, Xiaofei had an accident.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.760
He fell from upstairs.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.790
That day, Dong and Xiaojun

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.610
were the first to call an ambulance

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.440
and took my son to the hospital.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.230
People at the site said

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.310
they weren't even close.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.200
Dong is a man of few words

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.130
and doesn't talk much with anyone.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.370
My son actually had

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.880
some good friends there.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.750
But when trouble came,
they all backed down.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:20.920
Only Dong and Xiaojun

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.980
stepped up to help.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.710
When Xiaofei was taken to the hospital,

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.480
he was already beyond saving.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.630
How did Ni Xiangdong

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.720
and Cao Xiaojun know each other?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.360
Probably at the construction site.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.150
When Dong asked me to buy a car,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.170
he mentioned

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.930
they were as close as brothers.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.220
Officer,

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.360
Dong is truly a good person.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.200
If you don't believe me,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.300
you can ask others.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.380
Anyone working with Dong

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.550
said he was good.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.310
You said he broke the law.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.680
I really don't believe it.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.580
You didn't even

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.750
have some water.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.390
Don't bother.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.790
Sorry for the trouble.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.720
Let me lock the door.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.520
Lock the door.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.680
Don't feel burdened.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.920
Okay.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.550
Ni Xiangdong got away this time.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.920
If he commits another crime,

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.750
would this old man be considered

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.450
harboring a criminal?

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.070
Wait a minute.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.070
Don't just criticize others.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.270
Let's talk about you.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.530
What mistakes did you make?

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.730
I shouldn't have scared the interviewee.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.920
I shouldn't have revealed

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.920
too much information about the suspects.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.350
I should ask leading questions.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.950
What else?

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.070
And,

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.640
I shouldn't make subjective assumptions.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.500
Anything else?

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.780
That's all, I think.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.960
How can that be all?

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.020
You missed the most important point.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.310
When we entered the yard,

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.710
you rushed in headfirst.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:57.440
What if when you entered the room,

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.790
Ni Xiangdong was cornered inside

00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:59.880

but working in the field is another.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.400
your bike has been caught.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.510
I'll contact you later
to collect your bike.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.640
Thank you.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.750
Many thanks to you police officers then.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.550
Have some tea.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.290
You're welcome.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.610
You can come to us for anything.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:27.790

Come find us if you need anything else.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:29.830
Alright.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.310
Have some tea.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.920
Thank you.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.720

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.350
Mr. Xu should be here by now.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.240
He might be in my office.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.880
Please bring him over.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.080
Yes, Director Jiang.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.510
Thank you for your help, Director Jiang.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.550
Don't mention it.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.300
There's something I need to tell you.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.440
Those two people you're looking for,

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.840
I really don't know them.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.590
But I've found someone for you.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:51.190
This Mr. Xu I just mentioned.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.270
First, he's from the north,

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.950
so you'll communicate well.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.720
Second,

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.640
he used to work at the grassroots level.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.030
No one is more suitable than him.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:29:59.550
Director Jiang.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.880
I'm sorry.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.920
I'm late.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.720
My scooter

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.830
had some issues.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.640
You're still using

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.770
that kind of excuse?

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.550
You were drinking last night, weren't you?

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.030
Just a little bit.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.670
It's not a problem.
I didn't break any rules.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.200
Rules?

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.000
What rules?

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.160
You're already retired.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:15.940
Don't keep talking about

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.540
breaking rules all the time.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.510
These two are colleagues from Weihai.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.000
-Meng Zhao. Officer Meng.
-Meng Zhao.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.640
Tong.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.310
Thank you.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.960
Hello.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.440
Don't mention it.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:26.550
Director Jiang here

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.260
called me back

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.860
to make use of my experience.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.510
Have a seat.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.430
You said you wanted to know about

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.240
Ni Xiangdong and Cao Xiaojun,

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:34.660
right?

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.030
Yes.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.550
For this matter,

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.960
you've come to the right person.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.350
I'm retired now anyway.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:40.270
So,

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.030
I can be more discreet

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.450
about what I say.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:44.170
Good.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.770
Time flies.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.010
It's been over 10 years.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.550
When I was transferred
from the provincial capital to Jialin,

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.550
I thought

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.770
this small city would be more relaxed.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.450
But after arriving, I found

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.740
this little Jialin

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.350
was full of hidden dangers.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.020
That was years ago.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.640
It's all been cleaned up now.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.550
Those criminals

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.310
were executed,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.310
and the rest are still in prison.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.200
Director Jiang is referring to

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.070
the Bao family in the north

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.930
and the Liang family in the south.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.110
Ni Xiangdong and Cao Xiaojun

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.960
don't even rank.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:20.590
They first

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:22.870
started hanging around Huayuan Street.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.200
Later, Liang Da from the Liang family

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.970
gave Ni Xiangdong a dock

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.600
to manage.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.000
Fishing boss.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.030
Just collecting protection money,

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.090
and smuggling too.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.400
He was executed.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.590
Liang Da?

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.240
He was shot to death in 2007.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:36.720
Yes.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:37.350
Drug trafficking.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.640
Right.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.270
Sorry for interrupting.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.110
Please continue.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.720
It's fine.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.920
Executed.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.030
Actually, I can say

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.120
I watched Ni Xiangdong and Cao Xiaojun

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.950
grow from small-time thugs

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.460
into big-time gangsters.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:50.960
At that time, we

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.090
couldn't contact his parents either.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.350
Maybe in 1992...

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.160
Get up!

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.920
Giving up?

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.110
Giving up?

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.640
Police are here!

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.640
-Police!
-Freeze!

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.030
Stop!

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.620
Freeze!

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.540

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.160
Stop!

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.240
Freeze!

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.910
Come here!

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:10.400
Stop!

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.010
Still trying to run?

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.960
Ni Xiangdong.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.160
You again.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.250
What did I tell you before?

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.410
Wasted my words.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.350
They hit me first!

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.350
Put your shoes on.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.530
You're so stubborn.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:25.310
They hit you.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.310
Did you fight back?

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.370
Fighting back means mutual assault.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.720
Whose motorcycle is this?

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.440
Mine.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.830
Stolen, right?

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:32.960
I bought it with my own money.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.000
Where did you get the money?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.130
My boss gave it to me.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.250
Get it up.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.280
Take it away.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.510
Look.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.080
He was so young,

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:48.270
yet so vicious.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.070
This scar,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.400
I'll have it for life.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.680
Ni Xiangdong is that kind of person.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.400
Wicked

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.680
and cunning.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:57.880
He's never been a good person

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.790
since childhood.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.120
What about Cao Xiaojun?

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.510
Cao Xiaojun,

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.120
compared to him,

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.880
is somewhat more honest.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.130
He's the type who's

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:08.070
ruthless but doesn't talk much.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.110
Anyway, when he breaks the law,
he admits it.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.210
He often covers for Ni Xiangdong,

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.200

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.160

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.440

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.880
Don't worry,

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:27.550
I'm not trying to follow you.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.920
Whatever Ni Xiangdong did

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.800
in your jurisdiction,

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.000
it's not my place to ask.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.460
But I know this Jialin area

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:33.330
very well.

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:34.670
[Youth Supermarket]

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.920
My name is Xu Qingchun,

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.400
meaning "Youth Without Regrets."

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:37.920
I'm leaving.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.280
Okay.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:38.670
Goodbye.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:39.030
Bye-bye.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.070
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:43.400
Youth Without Regrets.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.960
Why do I feel that the old guy

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.489
is still hiding something?

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.820
Show some respect.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.070
Xu is older than your father.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:51.929
Let's go.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:08.070
Mentor,

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:10.730
is this your arrangement?

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.790
We're lucky to even have this vehicle.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:17.450
Larger vehicles can't even
make it up this road.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:23.370
Get off now.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.930
Walk that way
and you'll reach Yafen Village.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:28.920
Sir, please

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.590
just drive us up there.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.850
Drive further?

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.030
My chicks are already overheated.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.030
It's so hot today.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.020
You can walk.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.960
Get off. Get off now.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.290
Get off. The chicks are getting carsick.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.770
Ma'am, on such a hot day,

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.670
you want us to hike up?

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.130
What's more important, people or chickens?

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.190
Which way?

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.740
Hand me the map.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.900
Isn't this Yafen Village?

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.360
It's only about half a mile, at most.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:16.890
Let's go.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.190
At most half a mile. Come on.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.800
Really?

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.400
Yes.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.510
Are you sure?

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.070
Yes.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:23.280
But according to the map,

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.110
shouldn't we go backward?

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:24.510
No,

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.450
we definitely need to go forward.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.730
Let's take a break.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:38.690
Let's take a break.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.090
No more breaks.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.880
The more we rest,
the more tired we'll get.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.000
Mentor, this place is deserted.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.230
Where is everyone?

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.150
Are they working in the fields?

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.000
Hello.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.080
Someone's here.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.370
There's someone. Let's go.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:42.110
Sir!

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.000
Sir!

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:46.800
Sir,

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.280
is Xu Caizeng

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:49.800
in this village?

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.070
Xu Caizeng from Group Six.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.160
What do you want?

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.740
We're from Weihai Police.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.280
Hello.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.110
Officers,

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.230
what brings you here?

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.280
Nothing. We're just here

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.670
to gather some information.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.190
What's happened with my uncle now?

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.080
No, nothing.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:10.370
We're just passing by.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.960
Yes.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.630
This is the old village.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.710
Many people have moved

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.910
to the new village across the mountain.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.040
Now there are only

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.330
7 or 8 households left.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:20.920
Okay.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:21.710
Thank you.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.440
Thank you, sir.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.630
Here, have some tea.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:24.320
Okay.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:24.800
[Li Gao]

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.230
Okay, thank you.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:29.790
Thank you.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.470
Uncle!

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:36.760
Officers,

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.940
what may I call you?

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.070
I'm Meng Zhao,

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.590
and this is Tong Hao.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:41.550
Tong Hao.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880
Nice to meet you, Officer Meng.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.340
I'm Xu Qingdong,

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.190
the head of the village committee.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.480
You can call me Xu.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.190
Officers,

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.410
why are you looking for Uncle Caizeng?

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.510
Just asking some questions.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.710
Yes, just inquiring.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.550
Just gathering information.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:55.810
This is Uncle Caizeng.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:59.320
Uncle Caizeng is old now.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.630
His eyesight is poor,

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.510
and his hearing has deteriorated
in recent years.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.030
He can't do heavy work anymore.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.890
He relies on

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.400
support from the village.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.810
Has anyone been

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.440
sending him money recently?

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.110
Right.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.360
Now that you mention it,

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.840
I almost forgot about that.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.800
Indeed,

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.320
he occasionally receives some money.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:17.850
Sir.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.840
Regarding the money,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.000
you can ask me.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.280
Uncle Caizeng isn't able to go.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.760
I always take the receipt

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.440
to town to collect it for him.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.320
I know better than him.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.000
Do you know who's

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.400
been sending the money?

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.090
I don't know.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.490
Someone called Ni Xiangdong, right?

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:35.360
I don't know.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.110
No such person in the village?

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.040
No, there isn't.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:38.800
Then do you know

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.330
why he keeps sending money?

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:41.710
Maybe

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.660
he feels sorry for the old man.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:45.480
They say the wealthy develop a conscience.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.070
I think

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.840
Uncle Caizeng is blessed,

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.710
caught the eye of a rich man.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.510
So you're saying

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:52.630
you don't know who's sending the money

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.970
and

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.330
why he keeps sending it?

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.320
Who would refuse free money?

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.650
Is there something wrong with this money?

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.630
Take a look at this.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.760
Does this person look familiar? Look.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.360
Dad!

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:21.840
Dad!

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.110
I'm going to school!
