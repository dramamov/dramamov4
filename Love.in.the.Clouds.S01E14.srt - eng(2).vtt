ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.920
EPISODE 14

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.600
Ji Bozai!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The ancient divine stone's rebound effect,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.520
what can your meager cultivation

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.120
do against it?

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.840
If we do nothing, your primordial spirit
will be damaged.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.960
I can't stand by and watch.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.440
You have spiritual veins.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.360
What else have you been hiding from me?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.160
Speak!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.480
Who are you?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.720
I did come from Yaoguang Mountain,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.560
and I have ties to Ming Xian.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.480
I am Ming Xian…

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.880
Ming Xian's betrothed.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.840
I'm sorry.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.160
I can't tell you the whole truth yet.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.840
The woman who bound a heart
imprint with me

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.200
was betrothed to Ming Xian.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.000
After everything that's happened,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.120
do you think I'd still believe you?

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.960
Give me Twenty-Seven back.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.880
I'll prove it to you.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.720
He was badly wounded at Mu Qibai's place.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.280
If he doesn't get treatment, he'll die.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.440
Please.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.800
Twenty-Seven!

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.720
It's all right.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.840
You're going to be just fine.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.080
Ming Xian's companion beast

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.880
responds to me

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.960
because Ming Xian and I

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.280
grew up together.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.920
We were like twins from the same womb,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.079
inseparable.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.600
That's why Ming Xian's companion beast
answers to me

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.800
and resonates with me.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.680
Twenty-Seven!

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.760
What was your purpose from the start

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.920
in approaching me?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.840
I…

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.880
Ming Xian lost to you

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.760
at the Qingyun Tournament

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.840
because someone sabotaged him.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.160
Siblings at Yaoguang Mountain

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.520
were scheming against each other.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.320
Ming Xian has a half-brother, Ming Xin.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.200
He framed Ming Xian
as a traitor of his realm.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.560
After that, Ming Xian went missing.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.480
I suspected someone in the Jixing Abyss
colluded with forces in Yaoguang Mountain

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.680
to take him down.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.040
Now, it looks like
that person could be Mu Qibai.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.600
To survive

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.480
and to get revenge,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.800
I had to conceal my spiritual veins

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.720
and leave Yaoguang Mountain.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.800
Then, I joined Moonlit Blossoms

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.040
to get close to you.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.680
Admittedly, I had ulterior motives,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.760
but

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.520
our objectives align.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.040
Mu Qibai is suspicious.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.600
I wanted to start from him

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.160
and find out

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.040
who in Yaoguang Mountain harmed Ming Xian.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.160
I never once meant to harm you.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.280
I want to take down Mu Qibai

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.960
as much as you do.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.160
I understand.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.960
You want to stay in Wugui Sea

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.880
and go after Mu Qibai.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.080
Yes.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.600
I see.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.120
Allow me to guess what you'll say next.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.920
You'll claim

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.960
Mu Qibai has ties to Yaoguang Mountain.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.520
If I keep you as my aide,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.600
we might uncover
who's behind Mu Qibai sooner.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.880
Or maybe you're saying

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.160
that to outsiders,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.840
we're already of one heart and one mind.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.360
If I kill you,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.920
your sudden disappearance
would raise suspicion

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.280
and tie my hands.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.440
So it's better to keep you around

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.960
as cover

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.080
while I keep probing the netherbeasts,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.760
right?

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.760
I see that you do know

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.600
keeping me around is the wiser choice.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.920
Ming Yi,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.080
I'd rather kill you

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.200
than Mu Qibai right now.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.280
Immortal Ji, I'm sorry I lied to you.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.040
But the bigger problem right now
is the netherbeast forces and Mu Qibai.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.600
Immortal Ji!

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.960
Are you going to keep pretending?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.200
I'm not.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.240
My…

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.280
My spiritual veins aren't hidden
with Soul-hiding Nails.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.680
I used another method,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.560
which is why I overexerted myself earlier.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.880
Why put on that weak,
helpless act anymore?

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.040
Even if you die,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.680
what's it to me?

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.880
Twenty-Seven!

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.360
Ming Yi, are you all right?

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.640
Ming Yi.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.640
Twenty-Seven,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.440
we really are partners in misery.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.280
I just healed your wound.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.680
You just got a bit better

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.360
and now you're protecting my life.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.000
I never thought the repercussions
would intensify with each occurrence.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.600
Ming Yi, it's my fault. I'm to blame.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.920
I was too careless
and I fell into their trap.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.320
I'm sorry.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.360
If I caused your death…

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.240
Don't say those depressing things.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.280
I'm still alive, aren't I?

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.120
See?

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.960
I'm fine. You're fine.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.720
We're both here.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.720
This is the best outcome.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.920
And how could it be your fault?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.120
Our enemies were just too cunning.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.680
Right now,

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.760
we need to convince Ji Bozai

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.920
to collaborate with us.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.600
He defied the divine stone,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.920
carved the inscription for your sake,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.720
and was badly hurt,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.600
forming a heart imprint with you.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.080
You're a huge threat to him,

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.360
yet he can't bring himself to kill you.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.520
Ming Yi,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.640
our plan worked.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.400
He's fallen for you.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.720
Yes.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.480
I'm the heartless one.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.880
But what could you have done?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.120
Love won't save your life.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.800
You two finally formed a heart imprint.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.160
We have to get to the Spirit Well

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.240
and seize the Golden Millet Dream, right?

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.800
We wait until he calms down

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.280
and agrees to join forces with us.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.120
I think we still have a shot.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.760
For now, we've got to find a way

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.160
out of here first.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.000
Ming Yi has formed a heart imprint
with Your Lordship.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.080
Once she finds out
where the Golden Millet Dream is,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160
she can use that connection

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.040
to enter Your Lordship's Spirit Well
anytime she wants.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.280
We should kill her.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.240
I have a way to stop her from
taking the Golden Millet Dream.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.560
As expected of Your Lordship.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.600
But we still have to deal with her, right?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.880
She's still useful.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.760
Then, I'll get rid of the cat first.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.960
What good will that do?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.800
The cat doesn't have a heart imprint.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.160
Then, we should kill her first?

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.040
Buxiu,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.200
you can't solve every problem by killing.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.240
Even if killing her

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.200
might solve some of them.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.720
-Understood.
-Come back.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.920
I do understand.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.560
You don't.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.520
Go to Yaoguang Mountain

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.280
and find out what happened to Ming Xian.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.960
Understood.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.840
And here I was, talking about Ji Bozai

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.480
like he was madly in love with you,
saying how much he cared.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.760
After all this time,
he hasn't even shown his face once!

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.040
Master She was right.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.840
He's a scoundrel!

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.240
Immortal Ji! Immortal Ji, please,
hear me out.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.720
Mu Qibai controls the netherbeast army.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.360
Do you even know how to deal with them?

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.280
I do.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.360
I'm willing to offer you the method
to suppress them

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.400
as a sign of good faith.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.240
Good faith?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.400
How can I trust someone whose history

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.080
I don't even know?

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.320
When you're ready to tell me the truth,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.080
we can talk about cooperation.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.080
Immortal Ji!

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.080
Immortal Ji!

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.920
Immortal Ji, just hear me out.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.920
Immortal Ji…

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.840
My love, please wait!

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.240
I can leave Ming Xian behind. ̀I…

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.760
It's freezing. How can anyone survive
in a place like this?

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.640
Immortal Ji,

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.440
this cell is freezing.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.040
Ming Yi overexerted herself last night.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.280
I think she's fallen ill.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.760
Please, let us out.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.440
Immortal Ji,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.120
it's too cold in here.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.080
Why don't you come in
and see for yourself?

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.520
Talk properly.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.840
Immortal Ji,

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.760
I'm telling the truth.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.280
Ming Xian is my betrothed. He and I…

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.520
Immortal Ji?

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.000
-Immortal Ji. Immortal Ji!
-Oh, woe is me…

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.320
Immortal Ji! Ming Yi fainted!

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.280
Ming Yi fainted!

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.640
Ming Yi fainted!

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.040
Drop the act. He's gone.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.400
How stubborn can he be?

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.040
At least he's not completely heartless.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.080
Your Lordship,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.000
after the Qingyun Tournament,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.440
Ming Xian vanished from Yaoguang Mountain.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.920
No one knows where he went.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.720
There's no record of him
having a betrothed,

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.280
but he did have plenty of romantic rumors

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.280
back in the divine capital.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.920
It wouldn't be unexpected

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
if he were involved with someone.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.240
Ming Yi appeared in Moonlit Blossoms

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.600
right after the tournament.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.360
She and Ming Xian

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.040
must be connected.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.680
For now, Ming Yi's still useful to us.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.880
Things are complicated,
so we'll have to keep her.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.400
Your Lordship, are you concerned
about her relationship with Ming Xian?

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.800
What's that got to do with me?

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.040
Whatever their relationship is,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.240
Ming Xian

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.320
won't be reappearing anytime soon.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.480
I used to think he was an upright man.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.920
If he's in hiding,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.960
it's clear something's amiss.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.920
Xiuyun, let's go.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.600
Your Highness.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.640
Is your Highness heading to Wugui Sea?

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.840
Xiuyun, wait outside.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.000
You should worry more about yourself.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.440
You've failed several tasks my uncle
gave you recently, haven't you?

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.680
Can a dog like that still be trusted
by its master?

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.800
How unlike Immortal Ji.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.640
The more capable someone is,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.120
the less they'll submit to control.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.280
No form of control compares

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.080
to the virtue of tolerance.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.320
Is it tolerance, or merely endurance?

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.400
You'd do better to summon Ji Bozai
for an audience.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.520
That would be much more appropriate.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.720
If you came just to say that,

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.640
you can leave.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.200
Your Highness may use Ji Bozai,

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.079
but don't defend him,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.640
and certainly don't turn

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.720
against Lord Hanfeng for his sake.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.400
Thanks for the reminder.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.599
There's something

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.600
I should've cleared up long ago.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.480
It was my decision

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.280
to include you in the warrior selection.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.280
I thought

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.600
maybe one day I could turn you to my side.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.600
You had my uncle's trust,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.240
and he placed you with my father
to watch over his health.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.120
I figured if you helped me,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.600
I could keep my father safe.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.520
But I was wrong.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.320
It's understandable

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.280
that you'd ally with my uncle
to secure your future.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.000
I shouldn't have expected anything else.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I won't anymore.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.440
Oh,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.960
and if you don't wish to join
the warrior selection,

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.480
feel free to withdraw anytime.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.920
Tianji,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.440
I…

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.000
Let go of me.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.200
You could've warned me

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.680
about Ming Yi.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.760
Instead, you led people into
Shouhua Academy

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.960
and left me to humiliate myself

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.240
in the only place I could control.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.880
I know

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.520
it was foolish of me to expect
anything from you.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.120
I never should've.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.200
But it's you.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.280
You know

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.200
how I've always felt since we were little.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.040
It's time we put a stop to this.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.120
It's meaningless to me now.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.920
He really won't show up.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.240
-It's Ji Bozai. He's here.
-Cut it out.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.480
Ji Bozai. Ji Bozai's here.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.840
My Lord, I've decided. I…

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.720
Princess Tianji has summoned us.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.080
Come with me.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.760
Of course.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.720
As long as I'm useful to you.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.440
Say one more word
and you'll be back in that cell.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.080
But…

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.160
What about me? Ming… Ming… Ming Yi!

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.120
You're just going to leave me here?

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.440
This is abuse!

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.080
Ming Yi!

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.000
Is there a reason Your Highness wished

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.280
to see us?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.240
After everything that happened,

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.720
I must look into it.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.240
What else do you want to know?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.120
Mu Qibai

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.400
set my wife up

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.040
to strip me of my status as warrior.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.480
Isn't that obvious?

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.720
What more is there to ask?

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.040
Of course, there is.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.760
For example,

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.640
when did you take in Ming Xian's
companion beast?

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.200
Ji Bozai,

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.880
we're allies,

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.240
but you hide too much from me.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.040
You worry for nothing, Your Highness.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.040
Lord Hanfeng's been trying
to move against my husband,

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.960
planting spies across Wugui Sea.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.400
When they found out

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.560
my husband sheltered Ming Xian's
companion beast,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.120
they used that to slander us.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.560
Fortunately, Your Highness stepped in.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.040
If not, we'd never wash that stain away.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.720
Is that so?

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.520
I've been regretting it these past days.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.240
I should've

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.720
let Lord Hanfeng take you away then

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.040
and be rid of the trouble.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.480
Your Highness should know

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.520
Lord Hanfeng targeted me

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.480
because he thinks
I'm Immortal Ji's weakness.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.480
But please rest assured.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.120
Despite its scale,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.840
the matter's been handled properly.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.200
I doubt anyone will dare exploit it again.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.240
Therefore, my presence
will not pose an issue.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.400
Keeping me around

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.680
will make Immortal Ji more willing

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.760
to serve the Jixing Abyss in future.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.400
You're not as foolish as you look.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.160
Your Highness must
have more to your position

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.560
as Venerable of Shouhua Academy

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.560
than people claim.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.640
Claims? About me?

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.840
What do they say?

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.120
They say you're good-natured,
naive, and without guile.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.720
How offensive! How dare you…

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.000
Being described that way by others

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.360
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.200
The idea that Ming Yi is Ming Xian
is ridiculous.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.560
My uncle didn't believe it either.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.640
He merely needed a reason
to provoke action.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.960
Now that it's escalated this far,

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.120
all eyes at Shouhua Academy are on us.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.200
Ming Xian's companion beast

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.680
can't stay.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.720
Let it stay.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.720
I'll look after it.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.320
I thought that if Ming Xian ever returned,

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.920
I'd use it to bait him.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.040
Will that explanation be enough

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.640
to satisfy everyone at Shouhua Academy?

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.400
Very well.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.440
But remember, Ji Bozai,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.280
to outsiders, you are of my faction.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.880
From now on,

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.560
run things by me first.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.560
Of course.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.320
Your Highness.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.960
Thank you for saving Twenty-Seven.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.240
You were the one who got
Princess Tianji to summon us.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.760
If she wanted to see you,

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.560
I had to let you out.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.560
You wanted her to remind me

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.680
we're on the same side.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.760
I thought she'd want to meet us
sooner or later,

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.960
but I didn't make her do this.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.640
There was no need.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.040
A while ago,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.440
I sent you back to Moonlit Blossoms.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.760
You left and Yan Xiao arrived right after.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.040
Pure coincidence?

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.160
I'm sorry.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.200
Everything from the past,

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.760
I owe you an apology for.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.760
Please don't hold it against me.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.240
For the sake of what I can do for you,

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.320
work with me.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.000
You're clever.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.960
But Ming Yi,

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.120
being clever isn't enough to ally with me.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.000
I need to see your skill
and your sincerity.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.280
All right.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.360
To purge the unrefined netherbeasts,

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.800
one must use
the Netherbeast Refining Skill.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.880
This skill requires using one's own body
as a netherbeast vessel

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.840
to absorb the netherbeast core
from the netherbeast,

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.280
drawing it in with your body
before refining it.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.320
But it risks damaging one's
spiritual veins.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.400
You…

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.960
If you'll join me,

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.240
I shall serve as the netherbeast vessel

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.000
and bear that burden.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.320
Get up.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.760
We'll set three rules.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.360
One, while you stay in Wugui Sea,

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.040
you can't contact…

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.640
you can't contact anyone
from other realms.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.600
Two, whenever

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.280
I summon you, you must answer.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.360
Three,

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.480
you only need to tell me

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.640
how the Netherbeast Refining Skill works.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.480
The rest isn't for you to meddle in.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.000
All right.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.680
Mu Qibai and I were in conflict,
both publicly and behind the scenes.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.040
He'll scheme again

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.680
now that that his plot has failed.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.000
Finding proof he raises the netherbeasts

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.040
won't be easy.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.720
However,

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.440
that cat has been to Dragon Carp Terrace.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.360
Got it.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.720
He's been attempting to infiltrate
Wugui Sea with his people.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.680
We'll do likewise with
his Dragon Carp Terrace.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.960
I leave it to you, then.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.360
I'll figure it out.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.760
I won't let you down!

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.000
After the recent selection trials,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.280
Ji Bozai,

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.520
Chen Xi,

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.640
Meng Yangqiu,

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.040
Sun Liao,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.120
and Yan Xiao

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.880
are confirmed as the official warriors for
the next Qingyun Tournament.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.920
We have our team.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.600
I'll ask one more time.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.040
Are you all joining Shouhua Academy
of your own will?

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.880
Anyone wishing to withdraw?

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.680
Excellent.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.480
From today onward,

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.560
I expect diligence and unity

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.000
as you prepare
for the next Qingyun Tournament.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.560
Your Highness.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.920
During the last tournament representing
the Jixing Abyss,

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.920
I noticed Immortal Ji prefers
to act alone,

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.840
which makes teamwork difficult.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.320
I suggest we live

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.160
and train together to build rapport

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.080
to guarantee another victory

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.160
at the next Qingyun Tournament.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.040
That's a fine idea.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.000
Bozai's temper

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.280
could use some softening.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.080
The four warriors ought to stay with Bozai

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.400
in Wugui Sea,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.200
where they can eat and train as a group.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.760
Are you still trying to insert your people
into my Wugui Sea?

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.760
What's this?
Another scheme since the first failed?

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.200
Bozai,

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.960
if you still hold that against me,

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.000
I'll apologize.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.360
I only proposed it

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.120
for Princess Tianji's sake.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.200
Don't you want

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.440
the team to bond sooner

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.600
and fight better?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.360
I appreciate your concern, Uncle.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.000
But since this is preparation
for the Qingyun Tournament,

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.080
having so many people stay at Wugui Sea
isn't practical.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.280
Perhaps

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.000
the five warriors should stay at
Shouhua Academy instead.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.840
That would allow them

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.680
to train without trouble

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.240
and I can supervise every day.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.880
How does that sound?

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.560
Are you kidding me?

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.560
We're all lodging together
in one large room?

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.480
A bunch of grown men sharing beds.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.640
Disgusting.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.000
Chen Xi, you take that bed.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.560
I'll sleep next to you.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.640
All right.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.760
Yan Xiao,

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.840
you take this bed.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.400
I can't stand Sun Liao.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.320
I'm not sharing with him.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.520
It's comfortable, though.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.600
Ming Yi, watch your step.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.240
My Lord,

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.680
Her Highness said you're supposed to live
and train with the other warriors.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.440
Why'd you bring me along too?

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.640
Because I can't bear to be away
from you for even a moment.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.440
Won't Her Highness be upset
if she finds out?

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.600
My silly girl.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.680
What are you worried about?

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.160
As long as you're happy,

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.000
I couldn't care less about anyone else.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.280
What?

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.960
Why does Ji Bozai get a private room?

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.000
Because he's married.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.800
Then, I'll get married too.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.600
You?

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.360
More like dazed than married.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.960
Chen Xi, you don't snore, do you?

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.160
Of course not!

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.400
You dare hit me?

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.800
Come here!

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.680
My niece acts on a whim,
just doing as she pleases.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.480
She even made you
and Meng Yangqiu warriors.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.840
What? Instead of healing,

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.160
a physician shall now kill?

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.520
Does everyone think

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.880
they can rise like Ji Bozai

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.920
through the Qingyun Tournament?

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.760
Lord Hanfeng, you overestimate me.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.680
I'm not that capable.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.240
No, you're really not.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.040
Yan Xiao,

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.840
you once betrayed Tianji.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.200
You think she'll take you back
just because you changed your mind?

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.840
Know your place and do your job.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.240
When the time comes,

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.520
I'll wipe her memory

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.920
and give her to you unharmed.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.080
Her Highness isn't an object

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.320
to be given.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.280
Moreover, I'm unworthy of her.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.120
Whether you're worthy or not

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.120
is for me to decide.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.480
Keep watching Ji Bozai

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.920
at Shouhua Academy.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.200
Yes, Lord Hanfeng.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.280
My Lord,

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.680
you mentioned investigating
Dragon Carp Terrace.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.120
I already sent Twenty-Seven
to look into it.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.840
The place is indeed sealed tight.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.840
The only way in is to lure someone away.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.280
We're confined within the cage

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.200
known as the Shouhua Academy.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.200
How will we do that?

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.560
I have an idea.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.840
Ji Bozai!

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.600
We're married!

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.600
Can't you have a little more faith in me?

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.719
I've been loyal to you!
You think I've been hiding something?

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.080
You…

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.400
You're being unreasonable!

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.080
And why can't I doubt you?

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.480
You married me while
still holding someone else

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.680
in your heart, didn't you?

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.480
Let me tell you something.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.000
Cracks can't be mended.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.240
We're like this teacup.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.040
Once it's broken, it's broken.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.040
There's no going back.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.120
Ji Bozai!

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.200
You've got no right

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.360
to say that.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.840
Yes, I had someone in the past.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.000
But what about you? Are you so pure?

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.800
I'm going to become the strongest warrior

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.960
in the Six Realms.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.760
Answer me!

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.280
-Chen Xi, what are you…
-What do you have to say for yourself?

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.360
I did it for you. It was all for you.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.680
For your sake.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.040
Are you so sure about that?

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.680
Of course! What other reason is there?

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.440
What… What gives you the
right to bring up the past?

00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.680
If anything, I'm the one
who should be questioning you.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.160
All the times you've doubted me,

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.760
yet I've never asked about your secrets!

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.800
Give that back!

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.840
You…

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.320
The things you did. Ji Bozai.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.800
-The things I did?
-I've never asked about your secrets.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.920
-What secrets?
-Who are you to demand answers?

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.520
-Out with it, then!
-As you wish!

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.000
Where's all the rewards you won, huh?

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.760
-Where is it?
-They just got married too.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.120
-Prove your love!
-Men.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.240
Prove it to me!

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.440
-Yan Xiao.
-Got anything else to say?

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.600
What are you doing?
Eavesdropping on a marital spat

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.520
-in the middle of the night?
-Ji Bozai!

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.280
If you won't explain yourself today,

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.800
get out!

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.200
You think I've changed?

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.800
You think those ladies are better?
Then, go!

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.400
Go find them!

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.800
Don't return until you've assembled
all 28 constellations!

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.880
Fine, I'll go!

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.080
That was terrifying.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.680
Better not marry, after all.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.400
I'll be a warrior for life.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.680
-What a wonderful performance!
-Indeed.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.720
Look.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.440
I've never seen Immortal Ji
like this before.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.880
-Neither have I.
-How much has he had to drink?

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.240
Did Immortal Ji and Ming Yi have a fight?

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.400
Looks like it.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.560
So men really change that much

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.080
after marriage.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.640
The Mistress is here.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.040
Immortal Ji,

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.240
why don't I send a message to Ming Yi
to come get you?

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.960
You do that.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.760
I didn't bring any money anyway.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.320
Madam, Ming Yi just sent a message too.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.480
Now you remember me?

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.360
Ladies, ignore him!

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.880
Let him die out there!

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.480
Don't come back!

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.920
Let him die! Die!

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.800
Die! Die!

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.040
Die!

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.360
Die!

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.080
Die!

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.760
Immortal Ji,

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.240
even if you brought your own liquor,

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.720
you spilled all the fruit and pastries

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.200
on the floor.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.000
You know the rules of Moonlit Blossoms.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.640
We don't do tabs.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.920
Then,

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.400
send a message to my best friend

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.120
and ask him to come.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.000
Your best friend?

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.200
May I ask who that is?

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:26.960
Your Lordship,

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.640
the Mistress of Moonlit Blossoms
sent a message.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.000
Ji Bozai wants to see you.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.880
What's Ji Bozai up to now?

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.480
Could it be he got wind of our plan

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.800
and set up a trap at Moonlit Blossoms

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.160
waiting for Your Lordship
to walk right in?

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.080
He wants me to step into his snare.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.520
It's risky.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.000
We can't lower our guard.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.520
Then, let's give him what he wants.
We'll go.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.120
Bring all our men.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.920
Understood.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.520
Make way! Move!

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.080
Make way!

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.080
Bai…

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.240
I made way.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.320
Your Lordship, thank goodness you're here.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.360
-Immortal Ji insisted I call for you.
-Lord Hanfeng.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.120
He said you're his best friend.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.040
That's news to me.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.360
Bai…

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.680
-Stop.
-Bai…

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.000
I'm here.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.840
Qibai…

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.920
You made me wait so long!

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.040
Oh, Qibai.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.600
Listen to me.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.760
Men should never get married.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.640
Before marriage,
they lift you to the heavens.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.280
After marriage,
they trample you into the ground.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.640
Qibai.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.160
She didn't give me a single coin,

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.240
then kicked me out of the house!

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.800
I… I'd rather be a prisoner
of the Sunken Abyss

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.440
than a prisoner of love!

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.080
Qibai.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.880
Let… Let go of me!

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.320
Ji Bozai, if you're playing games again,

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.080
this place could be your grave!

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.240
Brat.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.600
Do you know what the real grave is?

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.640
It's marriage.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.880
Qibai!

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.280
Qibai!

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.760
I've suffered too much, Qibai.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.680
Ji Bozai!

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.080
Qibai.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.160
My life's miserable.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.880
-Qibai…
-Let go!
