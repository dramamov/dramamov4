WEBVTT

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.250
Nestled on a remote mountainside...

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.230
is a full-boarding school for boys.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.920
Shido Gakuin High School.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.090
It was here...

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.520
that I had an encounter that
would change my destiny forever.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.300
Saki Giichi.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.190
Or as everyone calls him, Gii.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.600
Gii was born in the States.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.140
He's from a super wealthy family.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.660
And he's the center of life at Shido.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.130
To me...

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.050
he was my complete opposite.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.370
Someone from a completely different world.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.430
But...

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.980
I love you.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.410
Takumi.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.580
Gii.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.840
This year, the rainy season...

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.010
arrived earlier than usual.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.720
And that day is fast approaching.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.370
June 15th.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.920
It's raining again.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.660
That means PE will be canceled, Takumi.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.850
What's wrong?

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.510
- Takumi?
- Huh?

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.170
What's the matter?

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.470
Are you okay?

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.070
You've been spacing out a lot recently.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.010
Yeah.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.370
I'm fine.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.300
Thanks.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.050
God...

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.630
please give me courage.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.800
The courage to confess everything to Gii.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.520
Give me the strength to face whatever comes.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.600
"Takumi-kun Series -Drama-"
(Episode 4)

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.720
All right, everyone, please get into your groups.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.290
And measure the data for the samples you've chosen.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.210
Yes, sir.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.440
I'm going to grab the chemicals for the next experiment.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.710
Don't mess around while I'm gone.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.270
Ugh...

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.540
This is such a drag.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.710
Experiments are the worst.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.050
If you think it's a pain, just make him do it.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.080
Hey, Yoshizawa.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.040
You're doing our group's data too.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.100
That's odd.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.570
Didn't you hear me?

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.350
Yoshizawa.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.170
Yoshizawa-kun?

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.020
Just leave it, Yamashita.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.240
Don't start with him.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.580
What's your problem, Yoshizawa?

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.070
You dare ignore me?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.550
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.420
Yamashita-kun.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.800
You've got a lot of nerve, Yoshizawa.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.090
Don't mess with me.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.190
Stop it!

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.000
Someone get the infirmary monitor!

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.850
Let's go.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.910
Sir, it's an emergency!

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.790
Yoshizawa.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.120
Let's just give it some first aid for now.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.710
Yoshizawa.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.120
I hope there are no shards in the wound.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.160
This is going to sting a bit.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.920
Thank goodness.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.720
The cut isn't too deep.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.260
Yoshizawa, were you on the health committee last year?

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.180
No.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.680
Why do you ask?

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.240
Because you're so good at this.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.760
I have a younger brother and sister at home.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.240
They're both quite a handful.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.750
So I've gotten pretty good at first aid.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.960
I see.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.320
Takabayashi-kun, how about you?

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.640
Do you have any siblings?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.040
No.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.170
I'm an only child.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.160
I see.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.550
You're probably thinking, 'That figures, ' right?

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.320
Huh?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.560
That I'm just a typical spoiled
and selfish only child.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.430
That's not true at all.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.930
There.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.590
All done.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.370
When Mr. Nakayama comes back,

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.700
make sure he takes a proper look at it for you.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.480
Do you really mean that?

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.610
Of course.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.870
Even if the cut is shallow, you shouldn't take it lightly.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.160
I'm not talking about the cut.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.120
Yoshizawa.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.470
Huh?

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.050
Takabayashi-kun?

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.320
Ow.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.150
Oh, are you all right?

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.390
Sorry.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.470
I'm so sorry.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.500
Well then.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.700
How about you kiss me to make up for it?

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.540
A kiss?!

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.170
I can't do that.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.710
What are you talking about?

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.030
Hey, wait a second.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.370
No way.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.940
- Stop kidding around.
- I'm not.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.180
Then why would you want someone like me to...

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.230
Takabayashi-kun.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.540
You're actually...

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.740
Seriously?

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.540
Way to kill the mood.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.050
But...

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.710
This is strange.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.760
Asking for a kiss out of nowhere.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.100
I'm the one asking you to kiss me.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.770
So just do what I say.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:16.910
But...

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.380
I've never kissed anyone before.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.130
Since it's my first time,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.660
I'll be terrible at it.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.730
Everyone's a little...

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.450
awkward at first.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280
So...

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.310
it's okay.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.870
That must be Mr. Nakayama.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.580
Damn it.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.810
It's all Yoshizawa's fault.
I'm always the one who gets in trouble.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.900
Are you just gonna let this slide, Yamashita?

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.320
No way.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.740
I'm going to make Yoshizawa pay for this.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.040
So he'll never get close to Takabayashi again.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.070
Takabayashi.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.870
Oh, Gii.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.380
What happened to your hand?

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.190
I see.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.570
So that's what this is about.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.050
And that's why that guy was...

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:47.930
Huh?

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.350
Who's 'that guy'?

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.430
Hey, why'd you suddenly clam up?

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960
Oh.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.390
Don't tell me...

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.420
you're jealous.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.950
That I, the one who likes you so much,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.200
was just saved by Yoshizawa or something?

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.330
Not at all.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.390
Hey!

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.390
You didn't have to shut me down that fast.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.000
Just a heads-up.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.220
I heard the former captain of your fan club...

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.160
is plotting something.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.330
What?

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.060
Yamashita?

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.120
Why would he...?

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.010
Looks like he's still holding a grudge about that.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.770
And he's taking it out on Yoshizawa.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840
What...?

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360
He was probably...

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.440
devastated when you,
of all people, disbanded the fan club.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.890
Now he has nowhere to direct all those feelings.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.870
You should be careful.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.920
Takabayashi-kun.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.850
Why would he want to kiss someone like me?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.590
I thought he was in love with Saki-kun.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.000
(Disciplinary Committee Room)

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.580
I feel bad for always making you help out.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.220
Even with menial tasks like this.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.240
Not at all. Being the committee chairman is hard work.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.260
Which is why no one ever wants the job.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.000
How about it, Akaike-kun? Want to be my successor?

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.650
That's a bit too much responsibility for me.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.750
I see.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.520
Looks like it's going to rain again.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.550
Yeah.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.140
But...

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.740
the days have gotten much longer.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.330
Do you prefer longer days, senpai?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.970
I do.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.820
When the days are longer,

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.730
it feels like I'm getting a little bonus time.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.360
You're very straightforward, Shibata-senpai.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.470
You think so?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800
Yes.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.370
What about you, Akaike-kun?

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.920
Do you prefer longer days?

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.790
I'm the type of person...

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.600
who can enjoy them either way.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.550
I see.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.230
Well, I should be going.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.980
Okay.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.750
(The faint mark behind your ear
evokes the flutter of a first love.)

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.700
(With a heart full of joy,
I softly chant the name S.A. - Author Unknown)

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.360
S.A., huh...

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.670
Can't sleep?

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.150
You haven't been sleeping well recently, have you?

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.140
You're going to wear yourself out.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.530
You know,

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.740
it's been raining non-stop lately, hasn't it?

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.590
The sound of the rain is unsettling.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.760
I feel so restless.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.150
Something's on your mind, isn't it?

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.590
Am I wrong?

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.180
Huh?

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.620
I...

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.970
Is there nothing I can do to help?

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.270
Gii, it's not like that...

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.720
I love you, Takumi.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.180
If there's something you can't bear on your own,

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.610
I want to share that burden with you.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.520
I'm sorry.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.240
I'm sorry for pushing you.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.170
Get some sleep.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.660
Good night.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.860
Good night.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.250
The kinder Gii is to me,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.600
the more cowardly I become.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.790
The fear of losing him

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.710
only grows stronger.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.470
After he knows everything about me,

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.570
will he still look at me with those same loving eyes?

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.220
"I love you, Takumi."

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.550
Will he still say that to me?

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960
Takumi.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.940
The thing that you're bearing all on your own...

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:54.010
what is it?

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.010
Again today,

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.430
it's raining.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.120
Hey, Takumi.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.270
This constant rain is enough to make anyone gloomy.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.020
It's a rare Sunday off.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.660
Want to go out for a change of scenery?

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:21.470
Shozo is coming too.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.250
Yo.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.750
Sorry.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:25.970
You two go ahead.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.900
There's a book I want to read.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.980
I see.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.070
Sorry.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.800
Well, if you say so.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.500
We'll be heading out then.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.480
So that's how it is.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.820
So, you finally managed to ask Hayama out,

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.170
only to get turned down.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.700
Takumi...

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.150
What is it that's weighing on his mind so heavily?

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.520
Right now, I have no way of knowing.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.770
Could it be...

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.950
related to his aversion to being touched?

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.240
Probably.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:17.570
But...

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.780
whenever I try to get close to the source of his pain,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.640
he just looks at me with those sad eyes

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.300
and won't say a word.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.010
No matter how much I care about him,

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.880
I can't seem to reach his heart.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.180
It's rare to see you so vulnerable.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:36.910
But...

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.250
that just shows how important Hayama is to you, right?

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.690
That's why I'm hesitating to take the next step.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.580
If things stay like this,

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.500
we'll never get anywhere.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.000
(Astronomy Club)

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.680
Who's that?

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.270
I haven't seen him around.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.970
Itami Dokoro.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.200
Never heard of him.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.320
Is he really a student here?

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.480
He just transferred from Shido Gakuin High School in April.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.880
He's a transfer student.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:23.350
Oh.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:24.810
So he's from our sister school...

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.890
I heard there are a lot of handsome guys here.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.340
The rumors were true.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.820
Takabayashi Izumi.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.880
How do you know who I am?

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:35.640
Do you even have to ask?

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.950
You're the famous princess of Shido.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:41.910
Hey.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.230
Go out with me next Sunday.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.190
Don't be ridiculous.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:46.860
You're full of yourself.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.010
Before you ask me out,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.330
you should take a good, long look in the mirror.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.260
Wait a minute.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.510
Excuse me.
I happen to be very confident in my looks.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.780
Good for you.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.170
And another thing.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.680
I'm your senior, you know.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.560
So what?

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.720
Excuse me?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.010
You should show a little respect for your seniors.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.580
Are you kidding me?!

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.050
You...

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.370
You're the worst.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.490
Just go crawl back to your old school.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.490
Takabayashi Izumi.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.290
Looks like he'll be a fun challenge.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.090
You're disgusting.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.990
Ugh...

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.410
I'm back, Takumi.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.380
Mm.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:48.570
Welcome back.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.230
Were you taking a nap?

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.550
Did you finish your book?

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.090
Oh.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.990
Yeah, more or less.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.580
You haven't had lunch yet, have you?

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.520
Let's go to the cafeteria before it closes.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.800
Shozo's coming too.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.530
About that guy...

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.210
I've got some gossip.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.440
Huh? But didn't you guys already eat out?

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.890
You haven't eaten, have you, Takumi?

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.950
Don't worry about us.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.250
Saki-kun's stomach...

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.120
is a bottomless pit.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.370
Gii...

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.440
Fragrant April.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.590
Falling cherry blossom petals.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.640
Meeting that person,

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.700
pales in comparison.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.150
The faint mark behind your ear

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.290
reminds me of the heartbeat of first love.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.250
Filled with joy,

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.150
I softly hum the name S.A.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.870
Author unknown.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.060
Oh, I hear this poem
is all the rage at Shido right now.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.140
That's right.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.540
It's totally a love poem.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.910
Everyone's trying to figure out who this S.A. is,

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:57.850
and who the author is.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.060
Right, Shozo?

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.390
I guess so.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.430
Huh? Wait a second.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.680
This S.A...

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.460
it couldn't be Akaike Shozo... could it?

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.940
Well...

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.020
I'm not the only one with those initials.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.180
Hey.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.200
This "faint mark behind your ear"...

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.800
what does that mean?

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.950
Since it says "faint"...

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.280
it's probably a hickey or something.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.380
Oh, I get it.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.380
I'll give you one too, Takumi.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.600
No way! What are you talking about?

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.210
This is why Akaike-kun...

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.530
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.190
Thanks for the fun time.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.240
I'm heading out.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.260
Oh.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.720
Akaike-kun.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.240
He didn't deny it.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:43.810
About the initials.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.980
If that poem really is about Shozo,

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.020
then the author has some peculiar taste.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.070
What a shame.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.000
If the object of their affection is Shozo,

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.380
it's doomed to be unrequited forever.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.180
Ah.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.050
Takumi, can I check the mail?

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:19.330
Sure.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.520
There's a package for you, Takumi.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:31.810
Huh?

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.740
Takumi?

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.020
It's from my mom.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.480
I know what it says without even looking.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:59.730
Takumi.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.350
No one cares about me...

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.010
Even when they're right beside me,

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.020
no one truly gives me their heart.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.500
Gii.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.440
Shozo.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:27.770
What's wrong?

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:29.670
I...

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.690
don't deserve to be loved by anyone.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.120
This is...

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.280
with Gii...

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.600
a place full of memories...

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.840
Don't be silly.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.160
The one I like is Hayama Takumi.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:53.830
Huh?

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.440
Not anyone else but you.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.810
It's you I like, Takumi.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.720
You don't hate me, do you?

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.340
I... I guess I don't dislike you...?

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.030
Gii said he likes me.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.420
Gii, who always felt so far away.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.600
I don't want to lose him...

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.790
Is anyone here?

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.040
So this is where you were.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.940
Gii's looking for you.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.920
Hayama.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.430
Are you okay? What happened?

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.560
Akaike-kun...

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.690
You're breathing so fast.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:47.940
Don't force yourself to talk.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.610
Akaike-kun.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.010
Have you ever been in love with someone?

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.690
- This isn't the time for this.
- Please.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.700
Answer me.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.350
At my age, of course I do.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.890
The kind you never want to lose.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.220
Someone you love.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:08.850
If you've fallen for someone,

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:10.860
you'd never want to lose them.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:12.770
What do I have to do...

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:15.200
to not lose him?

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.500
If you're talking about Gii,
you have nothing to worry about.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.030
- Just stop talking.
- Tell me.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.980
Akaike-kun...

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.080
Even if you lost Gii,
could you go on living?

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.350
Well? Could you?

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.720
Stop acting so tough.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.540
Takumi!!

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.800
For now, just wait here.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.010
Takumi.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.150
Takumi.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.200
Gii.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.710
- Something's wrong with Hayama.
- Takumi.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.390
Takumi.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.120
Takumi.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.090
Takumi.
