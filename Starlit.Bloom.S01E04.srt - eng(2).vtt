00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.359
Are you saying

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.719
the original artwork you posted

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.959
is with you?

00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:09.950
Why would the original be with you?

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.799
I met her once.

00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:17.710
Bring the original to the station.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.480
We'll verify it first,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.244
and then we'll see
if what you said is true.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.488
I have some paperwork
that needs to be filled out.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.566
- I'll take care of it.
- I'll take care of it.

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:36.760
Lu Xingchen,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.480
come with me.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.239
Is the designer really dead?

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.040
Can you tell me her name?

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.280
Lu Xingchen,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.959
why do you have Starry Sea's sketch?

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.239
Why are you messing with GL?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.519
Do you know what we've sacrificed
for Starry Sea?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.840
Right now,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.959
the whole company's a mess
because of this!

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.519
I'm sorry.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.640
I just wanted
to find her on the internet.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.400
I never meant for any of this to happen...

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.479
Either way,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.911
return the sketch to the company.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.080
I refuse.

00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:12.577
Are you trying to play games?

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.639
- Is this yours?
- Is it yours then?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.400
But...

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.280
She's already dead. I'm not fighting
with you over commercial rights.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.039
Why can't you let me keep it
as a memento?

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.560
Mr. Mo,

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.840
you've seen Mr. Xingchen's
flippant attitude.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.520
GL will pursue the losses
from this matter to the end.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:35.749
Ms. Gu,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.466
there must be
some misunderstanding here.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.520
Emotionally and logically,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.200
Mr. Xingchen just came back
to the country.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.422
He has no reason to target GL.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.520
Feelings and logic

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.719
are two different things.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.199
GL is under public scrutiny
because of this.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.599
- Who will be responsible for the losses?
- I will.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.800
Who do you think you are?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.759
Let me tell you, Gu Liusu.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.560
GL's works

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.800
are all just for show.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.599
And you're so judgmental
and disrespectful!

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:05.529
Because of your personal reasons,

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.000
you caused huge losses to the company,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.400
so you're fired.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.240
You think
I want to stay here to serve you?

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.240
Well, you're wrong!

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.960
You didn't fire me!

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.759
I quit!

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:21.560
Ms. Gu,

00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:23.400
I apologize on behalf of Mr. Xingchen.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.911
Please give me some time.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.000
I'll sort this out.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.240
I told you to keep an eye on Xingchen!

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.639
How could you let this happen?

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:39.439
It's my fault.

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.520
There was an incident.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.377
There seems to be some misunderstanding

00:03:43.377 --> 00:03:44.577
between Ms. Gu and Mr. Xingchen.

00:03:44.577 --> 00:03:45.244
Liusu?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.400
What misunderstanding?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.800
Gu Liusu is too stubborn.

00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:50.280
It's been published for a while.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.080
Does it matter who has the original?

00:03:52.177 --> 00:03:53.240
Tell her to name her price.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.400
I'll pay for it.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.800
I'll even buy the copyright outright.

00:03:57.444 --> 00:03:58.630
How can you speak like that?

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.199
Show some respect to your elders.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.240
Why are you so angry?

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.400
Original? Copyright?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.511
What are you talking about?

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.199
If there's anything, you can tell me.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.280
If I can help, I will.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.039
Mr. Xingchen posted
the missing person notice

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.719
that went viral.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.879
It seems he accidentally

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:20.279
revealed GL's unpublished sketch.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.279
What?

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.240
You posted it online?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.279
Do you know
how much trouble you caused Liusu?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.519
What are your intentions?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.959
Also,

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:34.199
why do you have Liusu's design sketch?

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:36.839
What did you say?

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.319
Gu Liusu drew that sketch?

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:41.920
Who else? You think I did?

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:46.839
You remind me

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.759
of someone.

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:02.639
Xingchen!

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.240
Follow him.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.920
Your son

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.040
has a lot

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.240
to learn from you.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.920
It's good that he's out

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.480
getting some experience.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:33.439
(Hello, Liusu.)

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.079
(I'm Volora's younger sister.)

00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:38.888
(Volora sadly passed away last week
because of the war.)

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.959
(Wishing you peace.)

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:47.680
(You inspired the Starry Sea project.)

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.839
(You're gone now.)

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.600
(What am I supposed to do?)

00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:58.310
Things are really bad this time.
What should we do?

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:59.639
I don't know.

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.360
Her close friend

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:02.319
suddenly died.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.444
Wouldn't anyone be upset?

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:04.560
Talk to her...

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.439
Where's Ms. Gu?

00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:09.040
She's right there.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.829
Bold of you to show up.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.750
This is all your fault.

00:06:11.755 --> 00:06:12.680
Go apologize to her.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:13.480
We're busy.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.199
Let's go.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.720
They say your dad is
landing a big project.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.360
Hand over some more cash.

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:24.977
Didn't I give you money last time?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.879
What are you doing?

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.959
- Let's get out of here!
- Picking on kids, huh?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.879
Mr. Xingchen!

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.959
Where are you, Mr. Xingchen?

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:40.040
Mr. Xingchen!

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.044
Look after him.
I'm going after those bullies!

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.879
Don't run!

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:49.120
Stop!

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.510
Where do you think you're going?

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.320
♪Frozen memories♪

♪Faded moments gone by♪

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.079
What are you doing here?

♪Your name struck a chord in my heart♪

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.319
I brought you coffee.

Xiaolu.

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:44.759
Ms. Gu.

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:47.480
Why haven't you processed
his resignation yet?

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:50.829
He was fired after only three days.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.040
I haven't even gotten around
to processing his onboarding.

00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:54.310
How many times have I told you?

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.879
GL's work policy
is to get things done the same day.

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:58.519
Do my words not mean anything?

00:07:59.444 --> 00:08:00.911
I'll take care of it right now.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.000
See yourself out.

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:11.839

Gu Liusu!

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:18.959
What exactly

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:19.680
do you want?

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:23.360
You drew the design, so why tell
the media the designer is dead?

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.066
Eight years ago,
when you were out scouting locations,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.680
you ran into some bullies.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:31.240
You saved a little boy from them.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.399
That boy was me.

00:08:32.955 --> 00:08:34.270
You dropped your design sketches.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:35.080
Remember?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.840
Stop.

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:38.000
Is that really your excuse

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.440
for posting on social media
and causing GL such a huge loss?

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:45.679
Sorry.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.440
I just wanted
to find the owner of this sketch.

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:50.879
I didn't expect it to cause such a stir.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.679
I did lose the sketch once

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.480
but I don't remember where.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.879
I have no memory

00:08:55.879 --> 00:08:57.480
of your "little boy" or the bullies.

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.360
In any case,

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.200
return the sketch to GL.

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:03.120
No memory?

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.720
Impossible! Look at me.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:09.840
Look at me!

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.879
I get it.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:25.200
You won't admit it's your design.

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:27.279
You claim it belongs to someone else,

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:28.720
and then create

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.559
a story about a dead designer

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:33.360
to make customers pay for it, right?

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.559
I suggest you write novels instead.

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:40.120
GL's marketing tactics

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:41.200
are disgusting.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.679
And it's all because of you!

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.159
I'm running out of patience.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.000
Baozhu had to plead for you repeatedly

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.799
for me to tolerate this.

00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:49.360
Don't push your luck.

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:50.519
That's all

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:52.720
I have to say.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.519
Get out of my company right now!

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.759
How could she?

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.919
How could she

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.360
not remember anything?

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.111
I finally found her...

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:41.879
I didn't even get to thank her yet,

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:44.480
and she already hates me...

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.480
Does she really not remember me?

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.360
Is she just suffering from amnesia?

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:01.360
Gu Liusu...

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:05.360
Mr. Xingchen,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.240
you've had too much to drink.

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:10.120
I can't believe
she doesn't remember me...

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.519
Who?

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:12.360
That can't be right.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.960
That

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.840
cold

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.720
and heartless woman.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.159
There's not a single ray of warmth
in her heart.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.399
She can't be the one I'm looking for.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.240
I'll take you home.

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:35.919
Don't touch me!

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:47.799
That's the face!

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.080
The face of a workaholic!

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:52.039
My dad's not even here.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.279
Who are you pretending for,

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.240
huh?

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:56.080
Mr. Lu instructed me

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.080
to take good care of you.

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:06.200
I know.

00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:08.320
It's that gold digger.

00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:11.360
She and that gold digger

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:13.679
must be working together!

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.919
Curse them!

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.639
Give me that gold digger's contact.

00:12:18.888 --> 00:12:20.200
And who is this "gold digger"?

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.240
Tang Baozhu, obviously!

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.080
He must've watched
way too many soap operas

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.200
to come up with such a pathetic excuse.

00:12:34.044 --> 00:12:36.440
It's such a typical story
where the woman rescues the guy.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.080
I can't believe he came up
with such an overused cliché.

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:44.039
The thing is, I really don't remember
where I lost Starry Sea.

00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:45.879
And it's not like

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.240
there could be
such a crazy coincidence, right?

00:12:48.488 --> 00:12:51.088
(The person who found my sketch
is my best friend's stepson...)

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.039
(And we even...)

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:55.120
(Impossible.)

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.720
(Not a chance.)

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.879
If it were me,

00:12:57.879 --> 00:13:01.559
I'd let him come back
to the company and make up for it.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:03.519
No!

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:04.909
Not in this life, the next, or any

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.244
of the generations after.
I never want to see him again.

00:13:07.266 --> 00:13:09.440
Every time I see him,
something bad happens.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.159
But you promised me

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:12.679
you'd give him three chances.

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:14.320
He still has two left.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.639
Tang Baozhu.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.480
Do you realize how big a mess I'm in?

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.600
Why are you siding with the outsider?

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.879
Nonsense!

00:13:24.039 --> 00:13:24.720
I would never!

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.559
Never, I say!

00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:29.300
To heck with that spoiled rich kid!
Not a single brain cell in his head!

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:29.670
Come on.

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:31.120
Let's have a toast.

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.879
I'll pour some more.

00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:37.879
Oh, my goodness! Oh, gosh...

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.639
It's everywhere...

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:41.320
Napkins...

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:47.159
Not bad.

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.279
Need help?

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.120
I need you to drink with me.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.519
Come on.

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:54.240
I'll visit the orphanage tomorrow.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.320
Are the gifts I bought for the kids
still with you?

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.000
Yes, they are.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.480
Bring them to me tomorrow.

00:13:58.519 --> 00:13:59.559
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:02.200
Cheers!

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.720
If Tang Baozhu is lying to me,

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.840
I'll kick her out of the Lu family!

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:07.720
Mo Li...

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.480
Do you think Gu Liusu drew that sketch?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.420
