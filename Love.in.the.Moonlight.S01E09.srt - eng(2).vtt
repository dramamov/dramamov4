"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 9)

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.664
Are you sure that this is
Prince Saenkaew's handwriting?

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.580
Nual said that she just cleaned up
Prince Saenkaew's room and dropped this.

00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:29.420
Why did he need to write a letter to Sasin?

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.660
You saw that they were so close.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.900
But when Sasin got shot and hospitalized,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.860
Prince Saenkaew never once went to see him.

00:01:43.997 --> 00:01:46.500
Don't you think it's strange?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.341
You're right.

00:01:49.537 --> 00:01:52.260
I think there's something
weird going on between them.

00:02:03.677 --> 00:02:06.300
You think people would praise your love?

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.500
You will be a clown

00:02:09.603 --> 00:02:11.380
and everyone will be laughing at you.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.141
What about you?

00:02:15.757 --> 00:02:17.758
Are you gonna judge me as well?

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.900
Our son hates me right now.

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:51.020
I've become a devil

00:02:52.157 --> 00:02:54.220
who gets in a way of his happiness.

00:03:03.223 --> 00:03:04.224
Come in.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.620
Prince Bodin told me to
invite you for a discussion.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.200
He wanted to talk about
some details of the wedding.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.980
My workers have done drafting

00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:28.220
the layout for the wedding venue.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.801
Please have a look.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.800
If you would like to add
anything, just let me know.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.580
If you think it's fine,
then I'm fine with it.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.981
About the business in Chiang Mai,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.300
my people also decorated
a house for newlyweds.

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:49.800
They can move in right after the wedding.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.380
Did you hire a clerk to work at
your company in Chiang Mai?

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.540
I'd like to refer one person to work.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.020
You can refer more than one people.
The business is new.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.000
I need many employees to work there.

00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:07.823
That's great.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.140
Can we refer Sasin to work there?

00:04:15.883 --> 00:04:17.820
Sasin can take care of Pin.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.301
I don't think so.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.140
When she is married to Saenkaew,

00:04:25.623 --> 00:04:27.060
my son can take care of her.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.660
The others don't need to follow them.

00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:38.261
Okay, I'll let you decide.

00:05:02.663 --> 00:05:04.340
Are you thinking about your nephew?

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.700
That's right. His
wedding is getting closer.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.060
If we can't stop them,
we are in big trouble.

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:19.740
Are you sure

00:05:19.963 --> 00:05:22.340
that Prince Kamfah ordered
someone to shoot that musician?

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.140
Why would he do that for?

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.620
Oh my goodness! Eww!

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.900
Honey, look at this!

00:05:37.897 --> 00:05:40.140
- What is it?
- Here.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.221
So disgusting.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.660
A wedding of two men.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.660
They aren't afraid of people gossipping.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.380
People these days
like to do strange things.

00:06:00.237 --> 00:06:01.238
Man marrying another man?

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.291
Saenkaew?

00:06:12.383 --> 00:06:14.984
What're you doing? People can see us.

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:22.180
Holy sh...!

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:27.180
Or…Saenkaew…

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.300
- and his future bride's cousin?
- What is it?

00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.740
What are they?

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.180
At the restaurant the other day,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.540
we saw them hugging like this.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.140
They can't possible be anything else but…

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.860
Really close friends, right?

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.051
Oh honey!

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.750
They are lovers.

00:06:46.837 --> 00:06:48.500
But bravo to you.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.021
Brilliant!

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.820
That's why.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.901
Saenkaew has never been
rumored with any women.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.260
He is gay, he is queer.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.940
He likes men.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.011
Disgusting.

00:07:07.363 --> 00:07:09.763
So Prince Kamfah ordered
someone to kill his son's boyfriend

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.180
because he's afraid that
the wedding'd be off, right?

00:07:14.357 --> 00:07:17.540
This is huge. It's not
only ruining the wedding,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.970
but my brother will also be humiliated

00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:22.700
all the way from Bangkok to Chansaeng.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.751
The best!

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:32.940
Now, it's my turn.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.100
Are you sure about this?
Let's go to our house.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.940
Why are you living with Sanya?

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.420
But there are only females in your house.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.570
It'd be better for him to stay with men.

00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:52.303
Sanya and Mingmitr are living there.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.300
They can help him clean up.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.971
Also, their rental house
is closed to the hospital.

00:07:59.757 --> 00:08:01.837
He can visit the hospital
to clean his wound easily.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.700
I won't stay there for too long.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.301
When my wound is healed, I'll go back home.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.300
Don't you worry about him.

00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:19.620
We're gonna take the best care of him.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.060
My wedding is in three days.

00:08:27.743 --> 00:08:29.380
You need to be there.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.581
You represent my mother.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.540
I want you there, on my happiest day.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.861
We should go

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.621
before the traffic hits.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:12.460
Help him out of here.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.620
Let me help you with that.

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:26.980
Sasin was discharged
from the hospital today.

00:09:27.717 --> 00:09:30.460
I heard that he'll stay
with his musician friends.

00:09:34.543 --> 00:09:36.020
He must be so scared.

00:09:37.557 --> 00:09:38.558
Good.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.820
The wedding will go smoothly.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.340
And it will end.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.340
My dearest Saenkaew,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.460
You're not the one who go through this.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.381
I'm right here.

00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:00.982
I won't let go of your hands.

00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:05.500
I know that you're in pain.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.660
Trust me when I say that I understand it.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.300
I understand what you're going through.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.700
I understand your fear.

00:10:15.123 --> 00:10:16.260
But I want you to know

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.580
that you don't need to
carry it all by yourself.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.940
You still have me. I love and
care for you more than my own life.

00:10:27.263 --> 00:10:28.800
I don't want you to feel guilty

00:10:29.497 --> 00:10:31.780
or feel like you're
fighting this on your own.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.200
This is our story

00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:37.582
and we'll begin this together.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.740
Wait for me a little longer

00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:54.260
and I'll try to find way for you
and Ms. Rachawadee to get

00:10:54.662 --> 00:10:56.462
marriage certificate
before your wedding day.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.100
I'll do anything for us to be together.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.140
While we're away and you're missing me,

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.620
please look up to see the moon.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.340
Please know that we're
looking at the same moon.

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:43.580
Why did Ms. Rachawadee
tell Sasin to live with us?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.060
And she asked us to
watch out for his safety.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.260
She might be worried that he
could come back to hurt Sasin.

00:11:52.637 --> 00:11:55.020
We live together so we
can watch out for Sasin.

00:11:57.257 --> 00:11:59.817
Why didn't he stay in the palace?
So many people than this place.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.261
It's safer that way.

00:12:02.303 --> 00:12:03.304
You're right.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.910
You need to watch Sasin.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.340
Let me know when he's alone.

00:12:45.903 --> 00:12:46.904
Yes, sir.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.580
Your nephew and that man
live in different places like this,

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.740
how can we expose them?

00:13:00.201 --> 00:13:03.200
Don't worry, the lovers will try

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.020
to find their ways back together.

00:13:05.983 --> 00:13:09.060
The other one is injured and nearly dead.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.851
So he will try his best to find him.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.141
Don't worry.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.300
I have my way to stimulate
them to meet eventually.

00:13:26.377 --> 00:13:27.940
What do you think, Homthip?

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.200
He looks good.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.140
After the western ceremony,

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.541
there will be a Chansaeng
traditional ceremony.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.140
He needs to try on a traditional outfit.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.171
Right.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.483
You look so good.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.260
It's too bad. Your mom should have

00:13:58.383 --> 00:14:01.620
seen you in your wedding day.

00:14:04.657 --> 00:14:08.420
The happiest day of your life.

00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:17.860
What's wrong? Why're you crying?

00:14:19.203 --> 00:14:21.900
Tell me, what is it?

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.700
Why're you crying?

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.340
You need to be careful when you're alone.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.140
Don't open the door to anyone besides us.

00:14:45.981 --> 00:14:46.982
Okay.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.820
We need to take care
of VIP guests at the club,

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.460
otherwise, we wouldn't
have left you here alone.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.741
Come on.

00:14:56.457 --> 00:14:58.100
I'm a man now, I can take care of myself.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.140
You two should get going already.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.460
- Go.
- Fine.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.101
See you.

00:15:57.697 --> 00:16:00.540
You need to find someone to

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.260
watch the entrace on the wedding day.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.700
Don't let Inthorn or Kalong
get into the ceremony.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.421
Yes, sir.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.300
Are you Prince Saenkaew?

00:16:24.703 --> 00:16:25.704
That's right.

00:16:25.797 --> 00:16:28.660
Who are you? How did you get in here?

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.020
I'm Sasin's friend.

00:16:32.837 --> 00:16:34.220
I sneaked in here to look for you.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.500
Sasin's condition is getting worse

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.201
he's about to die.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.501
What?

00:16:43.901 --> 00:16:45.261
He said that he wanted to see you.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.700
You need to go and see him right now.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.620
Saenkaew is running away. Hurry!

00:17:30.017 --> 00:17:31.380
Prince Saenkaew?

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.060
Who is he running after?

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.821
Prince Kamfah?

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.281
What are they doing?

00:17:50.383 --> 00:17:53.620
- Hey! Follow them.
- Yes, sir.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.740
Hello? Let's try the camera, honey.

00:18:12.037 --> 00:18:13.038
So pretty.

00:18:15.697 --> 00:18:16.698
One more shot.

00:18:18.383 --> 00:18:19.304
How was it?

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.860
- Very chic, honey.
- Oh well.

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.700
When Saenkaew comes here to see Sasin,

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.260
I'll snap their photos
when they're in love.

00:18:29.823 --> 00:18:31.503
And I'll expose the photos at his wedding.

00:18:31.824 --> 00:18:34.500
His bride will be so mad
and will call off the wedding.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.260
Sounds like a good plan.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.741
But it takes days to develop these photos.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.620
Don't you think the wedding
will be over once we get the photos?

00:18:47.397 --> 00:18:50.860
Why don't they have a camera
that can show photos immediately?

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.531
I know.

00:18:56.403 --> 00:18:58.304
They're here, let's hide.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.337
Sasin is living inside.

00:19:26.283 --> 00:19:27.620
Let's go, honey.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:10.263
- Who's that?
- It's me.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:16.951
Saenkaew?

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.701
Saenkaew!

00:20:28.001 --> 00:20:29.260
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:20:36.137 --> 00:20:37.820
- This one?
- That's right.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.260
- Inthorn?
- You scared me! Kamfah?

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.741
- How did you get here?
- How did you get here?

00:20:54.163 --> 00:20:55.164
You?

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.580
You planned to kidnap my son?

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:02.980
Kidnap your son?

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.220
Why would I do that?

00:21:07.494 --> 00:21:09.331
Tell me, what's you plan?

00:21:09.504 --> 00:21:11.020
What are you doing?

00:21:18.123 --> 00:21:19.140
Phong! Get up!

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.810
What do you think you're doing?

00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:30.078
How're you feeling?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.261
Still hurt?

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.860
Tell me! Where are you hiding my son?

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.031
Tell me!

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.300
I didn't hide Saenkaew anywhere.

00:21:44.661 --> 00:21:46.340
Right now, he must be

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.660
making out with Sasin, his boyfriend.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.940
What're you talking about?

00:21:57.343 --> 00:21:59.463
You didn't expect me to
find out about this, did you?

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.701
I'm not sure about it first

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.220
but seeing your face right now, makes me

00:22:06.623 --> 00:22:08.380
realize that my guess is right.

00:22:12.317 --> 00:22:15.420
- Stop talking nonsense already.
- What nonsense?

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.940
You already knew about it, didn't you?

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.380
That there's something going on
between Saenkaew and Sasin,

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.420
- that's why you sent someone to hurt him.
- What?

00:22:29.623 --> 00:22:30.624
Oh my goodness!

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.660
Prince Bodin is joining the party as well?

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.580
What a surprise!

00:22:38.803 --> 00:22:40.981
What does it mean?

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.340
You know what? When I got shot,

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.200
I wasn't afraid of death,

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.701
I was afraid that I couldn't
see your face again.

00:22:55.557 --> 00:22:57.658
I'm worried that my
dad will hurt you again.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.620
If that's the case, then
I'd rather give you up,

00:23:02.757 --> 00:23:04.197
than having something happen to you.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.180
I won't give up.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.140
And you can't give up either.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.380
Okay?

00:23:34.623 --> 00:23:37.420
Well, why did you ask him that?

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.800
You expected to get the truth?

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.421
You should have asked me.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.900
Sasin was shot and almost died

00:23:47.903 --> 00:23:49.660
because of my brother.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.140
He was so furious

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.291
that Saenkaew is having an
intimate relationship with Sasin.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.020
Come on, brother?

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.940
You know it well that your
son doesn't like women

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.420
still you tried

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.140
to get him to marry
Prince Bodin's daughter.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.820
This is a fraud.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.001
Is it true?

00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:23.620
It's not true. Prince Inthorn is lying.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.921
Stop talking.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.681
We should go and see
them with our own eyes.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.580
Saenkaew is now hanging out with Sasin,

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.530
after not seeing him for such a long time.

00:24:36.671 --> 00:24:38.900
Perhaps they are making out right now.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.460
If you want to see them, please follow me.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.860
Let's go, honey.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.901
But you can't sneak out
to see me like this again,

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.101
your dad could catch you.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.741
Wait?

00:25:15.463 --> 00:25:18.180
You told your friend to tell me

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.751
that you're in severe
condition, didn't you?

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.501
I didn't.

00:25:43.223 --> 00:25:44.397
Sasin!

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.740
Saenkaew! Open the door!

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.100
Sasin! Saenkaew!

00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:52.390
I know that you two are making…

00:25:54.277 --> 00:25:55.380
out right now.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:04.471
I…

00:26:05.163 --> 00:26:09.500
What're you doing here?

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.800
What're you doing here?

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.940
Saenkaew and I are here to see Sasin.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.940
Not true. Sasin and Saenkaew are lovers.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.541
They're fooling you, Pin-anong.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.140
No way.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.540
Sasin is a cousin that I love so much.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.301
He won't break my heart for sure.

00:26:40.663 --> 00:26:44.460
See? There's nothing like
what Inthorn said earlier.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.100
What should we do?

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.940
What do you think? We need to leave.

00:26:56.703 --> 00:26:57.704
Saenkaew,

00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:02.020
I don't believe you. I
will find a proof for this.

00:27:02.563 --> 00:27:03.564
Let's go.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.540
Prince Inthorn can't be trusted for
one second, always a messy one.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.980
Pin, Saenkaew, are you leaving with me?

00:27:25.517 --> 00:27:26.940
I'm gonna stay for a bit longer.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.550
I need to discuss something
with Sasin about the wedding.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.220
Should we go then?

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:38.100
- So they can talk about the wedding.
- Sure.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.420
Would you like to ride with me back home?

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.421
Sure.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.011
Pin?

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.380
Thank you for…

00:28:21.723 --> 00:28:23.500
You think that I'm stupid?

00:28:24.977 --> 00:28:25.978
Pin.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.781
My dearest Saenkaew.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.660
One hour earlier.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.020
Saenkaew?

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.900
Are you still up?

00:29:16.437 --> 00:29:19.638
I want to talk to you
about the wedding guests.

00:29:39.917 --> 00:29:40.980
Saenkaew?

00:30:19.183 --> 00:30:21.460
My dearest Saenkaew.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.620
You're not the one who go through this.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.701
I'm right here.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.260
I won't let go of your hands.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.380
You still have me. I love and
care for you more than my own life.

00:30:40.817 --> 00:30:44.300
I'll try to find way for you and Ms.
Rachawadee to get a marriage certificate.

00:30:44.777 --> 00:30:47.860
I'll do anything for us to be together.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:57.851
I love him.

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:04.940
I believe that you will be
the last person to hurt me.

00:31:07.154 --> 00:31:08.380
I feel like

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.500
I'm the luckiest girl in the world

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.220
for having the best
cousin and the best fiancé.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.740
I want the three of us
to stay like this forever.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.061
Sasin?

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.380
I gotta go.

00:32:29.537 --> 00:32:30.660
What's wrong with you?

00:32:32.637 --> 00:32:34.780
Why did your buttons look like that?

00:32:35.123 --> 00:32:36.123
Let me help you.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.940
Not true.

00:33:00.357 --> 00:33:01.820
Sasin will never do that.

00:33:04.637 --> 00:33:07.500
When I got shot, I wasn't afraid of death,

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.071
I was afraid that I couldn't
see your face again.

00:33:14.817 --> 00:33:16.797
I'm worried that my
dad will hurt you again.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.891
If that's the case, then
I'd rather give you up,

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.420
than having something happen to you.

00:33:26.017 --> 00:33:27.382
I won't give up.

00:33:28.983 --> 00:33:30.420
And you can't give up either.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.861
Okay?

00:34:01.463 --> 00:34:02.580
Follow me.

00:34:23.763 --> 00:34:24.764
This way.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.420
- Pin?
- Don't say anything, my dad is coming.

00:34:40.417 --> 00:34:41.900
- This one?
- That's right.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.300
Sasin.

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.500
I know that you two are
making... out right now.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.461
You know what?

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.460
You two are working together
to kill me cold-heartedly.

00:35:15.357 --> 00:35:16.358
Pin.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.100
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you do it?

00:35:21.683 --> 00:35:23.780
You're like my brother.

00:35:26.584 --> 00:35:28.940
You promised to take care of me

00:35:30.185 --> 00:35:32.380
to stop people from hurting me.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.260
Now you're the one doing it.

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:42.060
Why're you so mean to me?

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.661
So mean.

00:35:46.157 --> 00:35:47.800
This is all my fault.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.060
If you don't love me,

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.460
why are you so nice to me?

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.740
Why're you making me love you?

00:36:12.283 --> 00:36:14.180
I love you as my sister.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:18.260
I've never meant to hurt you,
I've only meant good intention to you.

00:36:19.017 --> 00:36:21.260
But I really can't be your husband.

00:36:25.123 --> 00:36:26.643
I'm sorry.

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.340
We didn't mean to hide it from you.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.660
I'm trying to find a way
to stop the wedding.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.860
Then I will tell you.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.580
If you get married,
you will be in so much more pain than this.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.501
I should thank you?

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:49.260
And be grateful for your generosity?

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.220
He didn't mean it like that.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.260
We still love you.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:11.380
Why does your love

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.380
hurt me so much?

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.900
I thought that I was the
luckiest woman in the world

00:37:28.637 --> 00:37:30.460
with the best cousin

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.460
and the best fiancé.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.500
It turned out that I was
too stupid to realize that

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.571
two men that I loved the most

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.700
were falling in love with each other.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.021
Pin?

00:37:55.923 --> 00:37:57.060
I'm sorry.

00:37:57.924 --> 00:37:59.564
I know that I did the wrong thing to you.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.700
I'm trying to fix it.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.860
I'll call off the wedding

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.460
and I'll tell everyone that it's my fault.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.501
I won't let the damage reach you.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.620
And you two will be together?

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.860
Congrats.

00:38:29.323 --> 00:38:30.590
You understand me, right?

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.231
All you want is for me to understand you.

00:38:38.443 --> 00:38:42.380
Does anyone understand me or feel my pain?

00:38:48.643 --> 00:38:50.900
- Anyone?
- I'm sorry.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.020
You think you can take
Saenkaew away from me?

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:00.381
No way.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.460
I'll marry him.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:07.820
- Pin?
- I won't call off the wedding.

00:39:09.197 --> 00:39:10.198
Pin?

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.140
Why would you do that?

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.800
You know that I can't love you.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.581
I will end up in pain no matter what.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.060
So I should just get married.

00:39:26.223 --> 00:39:27.540
And all three of us

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.820
will end up in pain together.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.940
You don't need to come to my wedding.

00:40:58.497 --> 00:41:00.220
You should stay home and rest.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:05.531
Let's go.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.700
We can't decide who to love

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.901
in this world

00:41:59.691 --> 00:42:01.500
or how our love should be like.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.340
You have a chance to be happy

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.221
for yourself.

00:42:07.657 --> 00:42:08.860
But my happiness

00:42:10.717 --> 00:42:12.300
and being myself hurt people.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.460
It hurts people I love.

00:42:18.637 --> 00:42:19.638
It's not true.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:24.300
You're just being yourself.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:26.820
You're not hurting anyone.

00:42:29.943 --> 00:42:30.945
Stop the car.

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:34.084
Stop the car!

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:41.631
Why do you want to stop the car?
You forgot something?

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.180
Saenkaew!

00:43:21.657 --> 00:43:22.658
Saenkaew!

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.180
Why're you here?

00:43:40.683 --> 00:43:41.984
I don't want to leave you.

00:43:48.957 --> 00:43:49.958
But…

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.860
I shouldn't have come back,
what if my dad follows me here?

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.300
What if he decided to kill you?

00:44:00.717 --> 00:44:01.718
It's okay.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.940
It's okay. I'm gonna be fine.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.420
Don't cry.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.100
We'll get through this.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.821
I promise you.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.420
I won't let go of your hands,

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.461
even if I have to die.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.140
Don't say that.

00:44:28.243 --> 00:44:29.750
How do I live without you?

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:12.763
Prince Inthorn was out of his mind

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:16.083
for accusing that there's something
going on between Sasin and Saenkaew.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.161
How could it be possible?

00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:21.750
This is all complicated.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.100
Sasin got shot,

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.940
Saenkaew's letter

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.540
and what Prince Inthorn said.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.300
I can't let that happen.

00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:41.820
It's embarrassing enough to

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:43.300
be related to a homeless prince,

00:45:43.677 --> 00:45:46.580
let alone being involved with a homosexual.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.061
Come in.

00:45:53.623 --> 00:45:54.624
This way, please.

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:04.831
Mr. Kuea?

00:46:07.417 --> 00:46:10.620
Why didn't you tell me that you'd come?
I would have prepared to welcome you.

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.380
I just got back from my trip abroad.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:17.540
I just heard that your
daughter is about to get married.

00:46:21.277 --> 00:46:23.220
That's right. Tomorrow.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.021
I'm sorry that I didn't invite you, I…

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.800
We're busy organizing
the wedding reception.

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.560
But we prepared an
invitation for you, here.

00:46:34.141 --> 00:46:35.142
Please come.

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.300
Please come.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:43.850
I heard that your future
son-in-law is a prince or some sort.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.340
He's super rich, right?

00:46:49.233 --> 00:46:52.460
So about your loan?

00:46:53.197 --> 00:46:56.620
- You'll get your money back, including interest.
- Good.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.580
I'll come here and collect
my money tomorrow.

00:47:00.581 --> 00:47:02.382
I hope you won't let me down.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.561
Otherwise,

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:09.020
I won't be so kind anymore.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.060
Well, please come to the wedding tomorrow.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.420
You'll get your money back for sure.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.140
It is how it is,

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.341
they need to get married no matter what.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.140
If I don't have money to return to him,

00:47:38.377 --> 00:47:39.900
he'll kill me for sure.

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.340
What if Prince Saenkaew was

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.540
a homosexual like what Prince Inthorn said,

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.300
what're we gonna do?

00:47:52.697 --> 00:47:54.060
If that's true,

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.300
it could be good for us.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.561
Sasin.

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:25.900
We've been thinking if
we should ask you this.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.300
About you and Prince Saenkaew.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:35.301
When we got back home last night,

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.302
we saw you and him..

00:48:42.581 --> 00:48:45.660
That's right. We're in love.

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:47.741
What?

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.740
What about Pin?

00:48:51.403 --> 00:48:53.741
She's gonna marry him tomorrow, isn't she?

00:48:55.037 --> 00:48:57.140
Saenkaew and I tried to cancel the wedding.

00:48:58.663 --> 00:49:00.460
Pin followed Saenkaew here.

00:49:01.383 --> 00:49:02.500
And she knows everything.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.420
Still, she insisted on
getting married with him.

00:49:06.057 --> 00:49:07.058
What?

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:10.220
- How could they get married when Saenkaew is homo...?
- Hey!

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.660
I understand if you
would be disgusted by me.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.500
That's right, you're disgusting.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.180
Hey!

00:49:29.403 --> 00:49:30.404
I'm sorry.

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:34.650
I'll pack up and find
another place to live.

00:49:38.043 --> 00:49:39.723
You have so many disgusting traits.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:41.700
Foul mouth,

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.580
too much ego, never
listens to anyone, unreliable,

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.183
and so many more.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.800
But not you loving Prince Saenkaew.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.421
What do you mean?

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.220
No matter who you love, men or women,

00:49:59.383 --> 00:50:01.421
it's none of my business.
You're still my buddy.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.301
You're mine too.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.580
You're my brother.

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:13.421
Thank you.

00:50:14.621 --> 00:50:15.860
Thank you for understand me.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.020
I don't understand about
what's going on between you two.

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.200
And I don't have to.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.700
It's your life.

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.660
I'm on your side even though
I don't understand anything.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.101
Thank you so much.

00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:38.600
Let me in!

00:51:08.183 --> 00:51:09.623
I'm here to tell you to be prepared.

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.420
After the wedding, you and Pin-anong

00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:17.420
need to get a marriage certificate
on Monday at the district office.

00:51:19.237 --> 00:51:20.957
Then we'll travel to Chaing Mai soon after.

00:51:21.963 --> 00:51:24.580
Why is it so sudden?

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:27.671
If it wasn't a holiday today,

00:51:28.677 --> 00:51:30.860
I would push you to get a
marriage certificate today.

00:51:31.337 --> 00:51:33.220
Please, dad.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.300
You know that I can't marry her.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:39.201
And you expect me to host
a wedding for you and Sasin?

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.801
How did Inthorn find out about

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.851
your disgusting behavior?

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.301
You really know what we did?

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.220
- I can fill you in.
- Saenkaew!

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.860
Why? You're my father,

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:58.020
don't you want to know your son?

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:00.941
- What is he like?
- But who you are

00:52:01.641 --> 00:52:03.260
and what you want

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.060
are about to destroy
your family and your life.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.940
It's not.

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:10.900
You're destroying my life.

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.701
You can hate me

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:19.460
or don't see me as your dad all you want.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:23.800
But you need to think
about others in our family,

00:52:23.983 --> 00:52:25.260
think about your grandma.

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:27.940
If she finds out about this,

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.260
you can lose her,

00:52:31.141 --> 00:52:33.142
like you lose your mom.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.301
If you continue to be stubborn,

00:52:38.443 --> 00:52:41.340
you can prepare to go to Sasin's funeral.

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.940
I'll go shopping for
something for Chiang Mai.

00:52:58.203 --> 00:52:59.541
Do you need anything?

00:53:03.683 --> 00:53:05.980
- You need to go with her.
- No need to.

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:09.620
He should stay here and pack up.

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:14.123
Don't you worry.

00:53:14.963 --> 00:53:16.220
No matter what happens.

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.100
I will still marry him.
