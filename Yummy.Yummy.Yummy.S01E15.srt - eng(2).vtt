00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.910
Shen Shaoguang,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.680
actually, I can hold my liquor.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.240
You fell asleep?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.240
We're at home?

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.430
Young Master.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.000
What's the matter?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.420
Your Highness...

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.940
Mr. Li,
why suddenly come to the Capital?

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.660
Is something wrong?

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.940
What could've gone wrong?

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.500
I was just worried
about you in the Capital,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.580
so I brought you

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.900
some food and necessities.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.580
Are you afraid I'll peek?

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.980
What?

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.380
Anran, have you become romantic,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.500
hiding a young lady in the carriage?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.500
You're joking.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.540
Does His Majesty know

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.020
about your trip

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.940
to the Capital?

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.980
It doesn't matter.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.540
I'm just a leisurely man.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.980
Even if my brother finds out,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.200
he will just think of it

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.020
as a trip for fun.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.980
No need to disturb him.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.590
Though it's already night,

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.280
there are still many people around.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.580
It's better not to stay outside.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.260
I'll get off now.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.800
Leave through the back door.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.120
Tell your family to avoid him.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.940
You want me to notify them now?

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.020
How can I manage that?

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.540
Mr. Li, please come in for a rest.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.620
Please.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.780
I've missed you so much

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.480
during the time I was away.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.740
I don't know if you're doing well.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.220
I've been used to living in the Capital.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.580
Don't worry.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.060
- Grandma.
- Yangyang.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.940
Can I use this?

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.170
This?

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.780
Go ask your dad to do it.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.780
Dad,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.340
I want to use this.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.380
Don't use that one.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.380
What do you think

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.380
of the one I've skewered?

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.980
Look at my sword.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.680
I didn't expect your mansion

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.390
to be so lively.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.740
Take this. That's too big for you.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.420
When did the guests arrive?

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.220
Please forgive me.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.340
They are the Shen family from Qingyang.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.100
When my parents were alive,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.480
they arranged this marriage for me.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.420
Three months ago,

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.460
they came to seek refuge

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.500
and have stayed since.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.670
When Rangzhi was alive,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.710
he arranged a marriage for you?

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.520
Why have you never mentioned it to me?

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.920
Shortly after the engagement,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.540
Father took us to the Capital.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.180
Since then, we've had little contact.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.700
I thought after my family's incident,

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.340
the engagement would be invalid.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.380
But now I've talked it over with them

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.090
and broken off the engagement.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.540
They have nowhere to stay,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.890
so they've stayed for now.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.770
That's why

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.410
I haven't mentioned it to you.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.340
You used to be very close to me,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.160
but ever since you came to the Capital,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.820
you've kept many things from me.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.620
Though you write letters home,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.980
you never mention the Shen family.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.340
I just think

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.540
they are not important.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.860
Is that right?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.900
But I think

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.700
you're reluctant to get close
to the Princess

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.270
partly because of this past betrothal.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.260
Yangyang, be careful.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.160
Don't fall.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.020
- Before,
- I know.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.700
you rarely cared about the Capital.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.740
I didn't expect you

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.900
to care so much about the Princess.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.010
Are you protecting this family?

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.500
You avoided my question

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.420
and started to question me.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.660
Anran,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.820
the Princess is
His Majesty's only sibling,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.380
just like Princess Guantao.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.580
The Crown Prince is still young;

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.730
his character is not yet set.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.940
The Princess will often give him advice.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.140
If there is someone
she can rely on by her side,

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.380
she won't make mistakes.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.580
I understand.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.740
It's getting late.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.980
You should rest first.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.380
What's the rush?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.180
Anran,

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.300
even without the engagement,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.540
I still should meet the Shen family,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.420
since they're here.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.580
Mr. Lin is so respectful

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.860
to this man.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.860
He even called His Majesty "my brother".

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.700
He's not an ordinary man, is he?

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.820
He is very extraordinary.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.820
Li,

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.260
to grill the lamb well,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.620
besides having good meat,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.380
the seasoning is the key.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.060
Shen, please.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.100
Look at me.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.660
Well.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.820
Let me learn, too.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.660
Go ahead.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.980
Is this right?

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.060
You have a natural talent.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.460
You have the makings of a chef.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.260
You flatter me.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.540
The smoke rises like clouds and mist;

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.220
the oil sizzles with a fragrant aroma.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.660
What a learned man.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.900
What a learned man.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.100
Jicai is here.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.460
This must be

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.740
Anran's fiancÃ©e, right?

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.100
She's too thin.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.860
She should eat more to be plumper.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.940
That'd look better.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.140
Yes, yes.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.260
She never listens to us.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.120
Mr. Li,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.430
our engagement has been canceled.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.460
No need to explain further.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.170
Lady Shen, nice to meet you.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.660
Greetings...

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.710
(The hierarchy is not yet very strict.)

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.100
(Though he is the Emperor's brother,)

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.620
(he seems very close to the ancestor.)

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.700
(We've invited him to barbecue anyway.)

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.480
(I might as well take a gamble.)

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.980
Uncle Li.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.620
May you achieve your wishes

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.740
and be content and happy.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.420
Clever girl.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.580
What a smooth talker.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.780
Anran,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.340
Shen and his family are so interesting,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.420
and we

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.020
really hit it off.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.540
Li, no need to say more.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.540
Try this skewer.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.730
- Sure.
- It's done.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.980
I've had grilled lamb before,

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.580
but never such lamb skewers.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.460
How is it?

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.640
Tender on the inside
and crispy on the outside.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.660
How nice.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.820
You flatter me.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.380
What's in Yong'an City?

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.340
Shen's Diner.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.180
Carriages.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.140
Capital Prefecture.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.100
Our ancestor.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.900
What did he just say?

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.100
You must be drunk.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.580
Our ancestor?

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.500
Nonsense.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.340
Ancestor?

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.540
You should drink.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.840
There's no ancestor involved.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.680
- Nothing to do with him.
- We have ancestors,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.200
but you can't say it like this.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.780
- My fault.
- Drink.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.660
I'll drink.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.020
Again, again.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.100
- Come on.
- I want that.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.580
- You go.
- Shen, you go.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.580
- What's in Yunshui Manor?
- I'll get it for you.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.580
A pond.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.420
A privy.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.280
A study.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.170
Security guards.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.460
What do you mean by that?

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.540
Security guards.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.020
Security guards mean

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.710
those...

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.940
guards who keep us safe.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.460
We call them security guards.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.300
You got it right.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.500
But you mumbled the words.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.260
I'm drunk.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.660
If you say so much, it'll be right.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.700
- Come on.
- Uncle.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.300
My dad... my father.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.700
- My father
- I'm your father.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.100
likes to mumble words.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.900
Please forgive him.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.120
Why not start with me?

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.700
- Let's forget that.
- Drink slower.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.380
What's in Juxian Alley?

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.940
- Handsome Shen.
- A chef.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.820
Wait.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.420
Both of you are wrong.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.660
It's my turn.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.900
You guys cut in on me.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.260
Uncle, you've got
the essence of this game.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.420
Uncle.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.380
You guys have a drink.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.580
I'll join you.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.580
This game is so much fun.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.380
Where did you guys learn it from?

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.940
We made it up ourselves.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.620
We've been playing it
since we were kids.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.340
We innovated it.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.300
You are really talented.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.980
Come on.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.620
I know that Mr. Li

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.980
is someone

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.900
extraordinary.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.540
I didn't have time to tell them
to avoid him.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.160
Will he cause you trouble later?

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.060
Come on, drink.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.860
Weren't you just bold enough

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.220
to call him uncle?

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.240
- Have some dishes.
- So delicious.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.100
This is

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.980
the Emperor's sixth brother,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.140
Prince Zhao.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.300
This wine is also very tasty.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.380
You don't know, Li.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.220
Don't worry.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.500
The Prince is easygoing;

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.220
he genuinely finds you interesting.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.310
Li,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.620
I can tell just

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.700
by looking at you that you have

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.260
an extraordinary presence.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.020
You must be an official, right?

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.220
I think your position

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.220
is higher than Mr. Lin's.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.180
Right?

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.020
Shen,

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:50.980
you have a good eye.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.620
How did you figure it out?

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.020
What do I do?

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.900
I run a diner.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.700
I see so many people every day.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.060
What kind of people haven't I seen?

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.460
Especially those officials.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.780
When they come to my diner,

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.660
I just take one look

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.660
and I know what they do.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.900
They look down

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.980
on everyone.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.100
You and Mr. Lin are different.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.060
You treat the commoners as human beings.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.220
Good officials.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.380
Shen Jianshe, that's enough.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.020
How many officials have you seen?

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.060
Where did you learn this habit

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.240
of boasting when you're drunk?

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.140
I've seen many.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.340
I've seen...

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.660
I've seen too many.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.700
Let me tell you something.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.980
It's always like this.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.620
At school,

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.980
they learn some knowledge

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.820
and how to be a good man,

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.300
but once they become
officials in society,

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.780
they forget it all.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.020
Full of bad intentions.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.220
Have you said enough?

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.220
We shouldn't have had dinner here.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.780
Mrs. Shen,

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.740
Shen is right.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.100
Well said.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.260
But Shen,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.020
I have one thing I don't understand.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.340
What do you mean

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.940
by society?

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.860
Let me tell you.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.260
It's like a university.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.740
Actually,

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.420
you have universities here, too.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.220
The Imperial Academy in Wuben Alley

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.580
is a university.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.380
Of course.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.220
However,

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.100
let me tell you.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.620
The society university is complex.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.780
For example,

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.900
your officialdom

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.980
is a society university.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.340
You learn a lot of theories
about being a man at school,

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.820
but when you come out into society,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.620
it's not like that.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.220
Who is the most powerful man?

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.100
The most powerful man

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.060
is the one who can keep his own heart

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.220
in this big dye vat of society.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.820
That's the real powerful man.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.900
You

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.460
and he.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.860
You are that kind of man.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.140
Your words have moved me.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.020
I'm moved.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.020
Shen,

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.180
you know me well.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.380
How rare to meet a bosom friend.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.500
If we don't hit it off...

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.300
Let me skip this part.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.460
We keep hitting it off.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.380
Yes, yes.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.620
Shen.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.460
Go ahead.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.860
To be honest,

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.820
with an elder like you

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.540
by Anran's side,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.580
I'm relieved.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.460
You're relieved.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.020
This brat

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.820
never likes to follow rules.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.020
Today,

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.860
is he okay?

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.710
Of course.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.070
At worst, it's just a few curfews.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.110
âªTo the ends of the earthâª

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.370
âªTo the corners of the seaâª

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.480
âªTrue friends are few and far betweenâª

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.820
The atmosphere tonight is so great.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.140
I couldn't help but want to sing.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.300
Is that even a song?

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.260
- How about I sing?
- Shen Jianshe.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.100
Sure.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.460
I sing pretty well.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.820
- You sing well.
- Li.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.670
You just played

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.740
this game quite well.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.740
Let's play a few rounds.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.960
- You go first.
- Okay.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:43.580
Ready?

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.430
Ready.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.980
What's in Yong'an City?

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.830
Shen's Diner.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.900
Cucumber salad.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.120
Did I say you can play?

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:49.980
Come on, continue.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.420
Why can't Shen play?

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:51.960
He's drunk.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.310
- He can't play.
- I'm not drunk.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.500
He's not drunk.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.820
- Don't meddle.
- Mother.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.100
Let's start from this side.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.500
- He can't play.
- Father.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.700
Your Highness.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.660
Anran,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.660
your family is a noble family.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.460
How could you be engaged
to a merchant's girl?

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.340
This family

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.660
seems quite strange.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.660
I've also been puzzled.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.220
But my parents never cared
about family background,

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.620
so it's not strange.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.500
As you can see,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.540
the Shens are not deceitful.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.700
These days,

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.900
they've treated me sincerely

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.100
without any unusual moves.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.940
Have you checked their background
in Qingyang?

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.620
Nothing

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.260
is wrong with them.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.020
You didn't go?

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.660
To protect this family,

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.340
you lied to me.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.660
I'm just worried

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.980
that investigating an old case
in Qingyang

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.780
might cause unnecessary trouble.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.940
Since you're planning
to overturn the Cui Case,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.180
why fear unnecessary trouble?

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.300
Do you know how big a deal this is?

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.060
I took a risk to save you,

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.300
not to let you be trapped in danger.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.220
How do you know?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.260
I was the one who raised you.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.540
Can't I see

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.500
through your thoughts?

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.780
I know

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.620
you'll find out what I want to do.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.830
But you saved me.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.000
I can't implicate you any further.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.360
Please stop asking

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.780
to distance yourself.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.820
You're really confused.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.660
To me,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.180
you're like my own child.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.620
How could I distance myself?

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.020
You are doing such dangerous things.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.790
I'm not even in the capital.

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:21.060
How can I protect you?

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:22.650
Anran,

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.700
you've changed your surname

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.500
and are now the Vice Prefect.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.540
That's a high position.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.060
So, you must live well.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.980
That's what your parents would expect.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.140
I understand.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.580
Enough.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.100
Why are you still like this?

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.570
Anran,

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.560
you've been in the Capital

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.980
for quite some time now.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.980
Have you found out anything?

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.980
The evidence in the old case files

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.580
is complete and detailed.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.320
There's nowhere to start.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.340
Lady Shen

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.580
was once engaged to you.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.500
They might know something.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.420
It happened suddenly.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.140
They were far away in Qingyang

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.700
and had nothing to do with the court.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.770
I've asked.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.290
They don't know anything.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.100
This family

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.060
can't stay in your mansion for long.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.420
If someone with ill intentions
targets them,

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.740
that'd be troublesome.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.460
Do you understand?

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.380
Yes.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.420
(Gentle and Calm)

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.580
Why did the Prince suddenly realize

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.940
that you want to overturn the case?

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.260
The Prince didn't just start doubting.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.940
Since I managed to come to the Capital,

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.860
the Prince had had suspicions.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.860
Just now in the garden,

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.380
the Prince was trying

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.420
to lure Mr. Shen into revealing
my abnormalities.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.260
The Prince is not in the Capital,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.100
yet he knows your recent situation.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.140
There must be spies

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.580
he has placed around us.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.540
Luckily, you're cautious

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.580
and have never told him everything.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.540
Before, I hid this from him

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.740
because I didn't want to drag him down,

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.300
but now...

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.140
Before,

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.420
the Prince always used different reasons

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.540
to dissuade you from participating

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.740
in the annual imperial exams.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.100
If not for the special exams
in Year Jia Wu,

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.660
you couldn't have become an official.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.700
In the end,

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.420
the Prince transferred you
to a remote area,

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.100
saying he wanted you to be leisurely.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.220
If you hadn't solved
the embezzlement case,

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.900
we wouldn't have been here.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.100
That day,

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.700
it was actually the Prince

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.940
who asked me to investigate that case.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.940
But I don't know if he

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.900
wanted me to catch Magistrate Dou

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.570
or if he thought I was one of them

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.300
and would turn a blind eye.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:08.940
Indeed.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.740
After you solved the case,

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.560
the Prince didn't praise you at all.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.260
What does he want to do?

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.620
Why did he insist

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.140
on stopping you from coming here?

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.860
What?

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.340
That's Prince Zhao?

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.820
Weren't you close to him just now?

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.300
How many lives do you have?

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.900
Want to join the imperial family?

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.460
I was just...

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.660
I even tapped him.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.660
Can I kneel now and apologize?

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.740
Don't be too nervous.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.780
Judging by the atmosphere tonight,

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.860
it was quite harmonious.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:55.940
Li...

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.080
Li?

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.500
I called him Li?

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.820
Maybe he won't be angry.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.500
Didn't you guys notice?

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.420
Prince Zhao was trying
to get info from Dad

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.290
when he got drunk.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.540
Dad, did he ask you about the ancestor?

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.080
I knew something was off.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.900
If not for Jicai,
diverting the conversation,

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.940
you'd cause great trouble.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.980
He did ask,

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.260
but I didn't say anything.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.260
I didn't say anything.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.400
Without Jicai stopping you,
could you have held back?

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.140
I know you too well.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.860
I just wanted to tell him

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.340
about our ancestor's curfew violation,

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.220
but I didn't say it.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.020
I really didn't say anything.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.620
And Prince Zhao

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.020
was quite friendly to me.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.180
He's a prince, after all.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.020
When he treated me like this,

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.340
I thought

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.140
maybe if I befriended him,

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.500
I could help with our ancestor's career.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.220
Could it be because Mr. Lin

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.380
made a mistake at work

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.900
that upset Prince Zhao?

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.780
In ancient times, vassals

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.660
couldn't enter the Capital
without permission.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.060
Yet he snuck in.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.420
There must be a reason.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.260
Jicai,

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.500
I don't think

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.020
their relationship

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.250
is that simple.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.900
Grandpa said

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.760
that the ancestor changed his name

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.000
because he was saved by someone.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:16.900
This savior

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.860
had such great power.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.900
Could it be Prince Zhao?

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.900
Did your grandpa really say that?

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.500
I don't remember.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.140
It's quite possible.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.980
Never mind, let's not think about it.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.700
Since he's already here,

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.460
we'll just treat him as an elder

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.300
and take care of him,

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.660
lest we cause any trouble for Mr. Lin.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.420
(Shen's Diner)

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.580
What?

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:48.940
Zhao...

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.580
Mr. Li has agreed

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.620
to come to our diner for dinner tonight?

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.750
Your parents

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.780
delivered the invitation to my master,

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.260
saying you'd host a banquet here.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.180
How hospitable.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.100
My master wouldn't let them down.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.020
Auntie.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.620
- What's wrong?
- What's the matter?

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.460
Get up, get up.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.540
Are you alright?

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.140
Dad, Mom.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.660
What were you thinking,

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.180
inviting him to eat at the diner?

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.740
Look at you, all flustered.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.420
Didn't you say so last night?

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.700
Prince Zhao is already here;

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.240
we need to take care of him.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.440
I told you to take care of him,

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.720
not to invite him.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.540
Mom, why didn't you stop him?

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.160
What have I done wrong this time?

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.580
Your dad insisted on inviting him.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.180
I thought

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.260
it was fine.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.140
Mr. Lin has to work every day;

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.540
Prince Zhao can't be seen in public.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.900
He can only stay at Yunshui Manor.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:48.900
How boring that must be.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.100
If we could let him out

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.500
for some fresh air

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.820
and have some good food,

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.180
how happy he would be.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.020
That's right.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.700
Besides, the safest place

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.220
is our diner.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.280
Once we serve him well,

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.340
it might even be helpful for Mr. Lin.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.640
I feel something is off,

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.340
but I seem to be persuaded.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.180
You see?

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.340
Jicai, just listen to me.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.340
Relationships

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.500
are built through meals.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.460
I know what I'm doing.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.500
We should at least let Mr. Lin know.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.300
How can we decide on our own?

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.060
Yes, we should inform Mr. Lin.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.300
But he left for court so early.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.540
We didn't get up.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.900
How about this?

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.300
You go and tell him.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.220
Alright, I'll go now.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:33.820
Jicai,

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.520
what's that on your forehead?

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.620
Don't forget to wipe it off.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.780
(Xuanzheng Hall)

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.300
Elders from my clan

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.540
somehow heard

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.940
that you don't even have a concubine.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.580
They all came to me to inquire.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.340
I heard from my family

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.340
that I have seven cousins

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.780
and six nieces

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.980
who want to marry you.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.300
The Pei Clan is also prestigious,

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.940
but I'm a nobody.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.980
However, because I'm friends with you,

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.300
I've become quite popular.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.500
How should I respond to them?

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.700
Mr. Pei,

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.260
when did I become friends with you?

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.980
One of the two ladies waiting outside

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.400
is truly a beauty,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.040
not inferior to the ladies of the harem.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:13.970
Yes.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.660
I wonder where she is from.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.180
What great fortune.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.340
There's a beauty up ahead.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.180
Let's go take a look.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.640
These officials who can discuss in court

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.400
must have ranks, right?

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.900
They're all looking at you.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.180
Why don't you pick a good one,

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.380
and I'll be your matchmaker?

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.900
Milady, you're teasing me again.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.820
Don't be embarrassed.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.460
But it's true.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.140
In my hometown,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.060
I'm well-known for being plump.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.100
Plenty of young men came to propose.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.900
I'm Eighteenth Master Pei.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.820
I admire you.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.220
After much thought,

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.300
I don't want you to miss me.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.460
(Xuanzheng Gate)
May I ask your name?

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.300
Judging by your appearance,

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.980
you don't seem unmarried.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.020
My sister

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.780
respectfully rejects you.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.860
Ma'am, did you hear clearly?

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.050
I'm Eighteenth Master Pei.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.460
The Pei Clan...

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.080
Ma'am?

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.220
Eighteenth Master Pei,

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.700
my family acts properly,

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.140
so they don't want to be blunt.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.220
I'll convey the message.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.040
You have a wife and three concubines.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.600
She doesn't want her sister to suffer.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.520
Can you understand?

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.180
Suffer?

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.210
Goodbye.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.140
Mr. Pei.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:31.980
Goodbye.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.620
Why are you here?

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.700
Making fun of me?

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.660
Come here.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.380
That one

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.980
is Mr. Lin's cousin.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.300
And that one

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.220
is the cousin's sworn sister,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.020
so she's also like Mr. Lin's sister.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.300
What you just did

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.290
wasn't quite appropriate.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:53.940
Forty-seventh Master Pei,

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.670
stop gloating here.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.020
Lin Yan's cousin

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.500
just runs a diner

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.540
in Juxian Alley.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.540
Look at how he treats her.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:03.780
Does he like

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.300
that frail, unattractive woman

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.860
and wants to marry her?

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.300
Then it's a blessing

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.520
that my niece won't marry him.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.020
You call yourself the twelfth outside,

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.580
but you're actually
the forty-seventh in the clan.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.860
Stop lecturing me.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.100
Even if I call you forty-seventh

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.100
in front of others,

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.080
you'll have to respond.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.780
My parents...

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.660
have caused you trouble again.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.580
I'm really sorry.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.380
It seems you always
get me out of trouble.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.540
Like just now.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.260
Treating Prince Zhao to dinner

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.340
could have been a disaster.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.740
I might lose

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.380
my position tomorrow.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.380
Is it so serious?

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.300
It'll be fine.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.700
You spent money and effort on my behalf.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.700
I'm very grateful.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.060
If a meal could bring me trouble,

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.500
that's my problem,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:07.900
not yours.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.620
However, the visit of Prince Zhao

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.060
reminds us

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.980
that we should find a place to live

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.300
and move out of Yunshui Manor

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.500
to avoid causing you trouble.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.060
Can't you just stay?

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.300
It's nothing.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.220
But you're wearing an official robe.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.340
You can't go like this, right?

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.180
Indeed.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.760
But going back to the mansion

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.860
might be too late.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.550
I have a robe in my carriage.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.020
You change then.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.380
Are you done?

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.500
How disrespectful.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.220
Mr. Lin, you said

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.180
an elder kept something

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.380
from you.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.820
Is he Prince Zhao?

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.100
Is he very important to you?

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.420
After I escaped death,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.460
Prince Zhao took me in.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.540
No wonder.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.460
I knew it must be hard

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.780
to change household registration,

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.140
and you'd need help.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.940
You're very smart,

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.960
but don't say such things

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.380
in the future.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.570
Mr. Lin,

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.380
is there anything to be mindful of

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.780
when dealing with Prince Zhao?

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.700
Anything we can't let him know?

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.220
He cares about me,

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.340
but official matters

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.100
can't be discussed with him.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:07.900
I understand.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.540
(Shen's Diner)

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.060
Mr. Lin, milady, we're here.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.220
Get down.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:24.980
What's wrong?

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:27.820
Mr. Lin.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.500
(Shen's Diner)

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.100
Mr. Li.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.500
Let me serve you some soup.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.900
- Okay.
- Drink more.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.140
- Drink more.
- Less for me.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:47.880
This wine is good.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.960
- Come on.
- Sure.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.460
Try our fish ball soup.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.300
Sure.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.940
It's really rare

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.220
for us to gather like this.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.920
- Usually,
- Yes.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.460
we can't see this child now.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.700
Stop it.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.800
It's not easy

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.040
for him to be the Vice Prefect.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.740
You're the only capable man

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.940
he knows.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.900
If he doesn't work hard

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.660
for the Prefecture,

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.540
who will support him in the future?

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.620
Yes.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.860
Everyone, rest assured.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.820
As long as I'm here,

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.940
no one will bully Anran.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.140
Thank you.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.340
Mr. Li, eat up.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.340
Let's have a drink first.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.500
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:29.900
Let's drink together.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:30.940
Let's drink together.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:36.890
Eat up.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.120
Sure.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:39.220
Try it.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.660
Shen,

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.260
after eating the meals you made,

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.540
I'm afraid

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.810
I won't be used to the food at home.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.460
Mr. Li, don't say that.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.620
Whenever you can come to Yong'an,

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.300
I'll cook for you anytime.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.660
Yes.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.990
What if

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.110
I can't come often?

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.340
You suddenly stopped

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.340
calling me Li.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.540
Anran must've told you
about my identity.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.620
My family and I didn't know

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.740
your identity before.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.500
Please forgive our rudeness.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.700
Please forgive us.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.620
Please forgive us.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.660
Don't stand on ceremony.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.060
Everyone, sit down.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.820
Come on.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:35.820
Sit down.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.860
To be honest,

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.080
I really hit it off with you guys.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.300
If our relationship becomes distant,

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.900
wouldn't that be my loss?

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.500
You all are sincere and trustworthy.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:48.860
What I lack most around me

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.340
are friends like you.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.930
Your Highness,

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:54.540
we are just ordinary commoners.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.500
How could we deserve such honor?

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.940
You deserve it.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:32:59.900
Shen.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.140
Thank you.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.500
These past few days,

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.100
I appreciate all of your care.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.460
Come on.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.220
We appreciate it.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.260
What an honor.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.580
You know what?

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.300
After having a few drinks,

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.140
I feel a bit tipsy.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.100
Shen, accompany me outside
for some fresh air.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.060
Uncle,

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.380
let me accompany the Prince for a walk.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.980
Yes, let Mr. Lin accompany you.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.220
Well.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.860
As soon as we came in,
we sat down to eat.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.860
I haven't had a chance
to tour this diner.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.420
Let your uncle accompany me.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.340
We can chat about the art of cooking.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.980
No need for you.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:33:59.740
Shen.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.500
You called me out.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.820
Is there something you want to tell me?

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.580
Shen, you're perceptive.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.660
Sit down.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.940
Don't be nervous.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:33.820
Have a seat.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.620
I wanted to talk to you

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.020
about Anran's future.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:45.700
Anran was promoted to the Vice Prefect.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.420
In terms of his career,

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.780
he is young and promising.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.560
But when it comes to marriage,

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:52.860
he's an old man.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.290
We are both elders.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.300
We should plan for Anran, right?

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.740
Actually, I knew

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.860
you wanted

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.660
to talk about Mr. Lin,

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.340
but I didn't expect it to be about this.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.980
Yes, we did have an engagement

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.260
with Mr. Lin,

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.940
but it has been

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:10.860
broken off.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.100
What I'm trying to say is

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.660
your family

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.240
can't live in Yunshui Manor anymore.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.620
Anran is favored by His Majesty

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.740
and Princess Fuhui.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.700
His future is limitless.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.660
I don't discriminate

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.620
against your job,

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.180
but the world is stubborn.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.700
If Anran continues to shelter you,

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.060
people might misunderstand,

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.120
and it could affect
his career and marriage.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.700
So, that's what this is about.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.420
I actually knew this,

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:42.940
but

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.780
we always thought of Mr. Lin

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.500
as a member of our family.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.780
Moreover,

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.100
the Princess's husband is still alive.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.620
Mr. Lin

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.500
can't really...

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.580
Knowing that you value Anran,

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.320
I dare to speak frankly with you.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.580
We both want what's best for Anran.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.090
But Anran's background is complicated.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.100
Your old ties could become
new leverage at any time.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.610
What I'm saying is

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.860
I want to take you away from Yong'an

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.420
and settle you somewhere else.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.740
Leave?

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.070
Your Highness,

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:16.780
though we are just commoners,

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.980
we still have the right to choose.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.580
My diner has just opened;

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.260
it's doing really well right now.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:23.380
The whole Juxian Alley...

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:24.470
Shen, let me explain my plan

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.500
before you make a choice.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.140
I'll cover the travel expenses

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.300
you need.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.340
You might not understand me well enough.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.980
This is not about money at all.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.860
I am willing to offer 10,000 gold.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.460
How much?

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.580
10,000 gold?

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.660
To keep you safe.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.960
(Start Near to Go Far)
That's 10,000 gold for the road.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.620
And he promised personally

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.100
that once we arrive in Sushui City,

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.300
he will build me a big tavern,

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.420
buy your mother endless clothes,

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.300
build a wedding house for Gongcai,

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.180
find a match for him,

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:05.420
and build a school for Yangyang.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.700
Is this for real?

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.660
This is my good friend, Prince Zhao,

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.820
who told me this himself.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.940
How could it be false?

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.040
This is a good deal, Dad.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.880
Good for you.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.740
Sit down. Wait.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.340
This can't be that simple.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.780
A tavern would cost a fortune.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.060
Why would he be so kind to us?

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.180
Why don't you understand?

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.940
Prince Zhao knows

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.100
about our ancestor's background.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.500
He might be the one
who saved our ancestor.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.700
That's right.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.940
The ancestor told me before.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.210
See? I told you.

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:38.980
Wait.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.460
When did the ancestor tell you?

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.740
How disrespectful.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.660
Mr. Lin, you said

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.820
an elder kept something

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.300
from you.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.740
Is he Prince Zhao?

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.820
Is he very important to you?

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.340
After I escaped death,

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.420
Prince Zhao took me in.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.260
He just told me.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.740
Why did he only tell you?

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.940
This is not fair.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:14.910
Don't get off track.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:16.340
Is this the point?

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.580
Prince Zhao and the ancestor

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:19.980
are actually on the same side.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:20.820
Prince Zhao

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.060
is thinking about our ancestor's future,

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:24.740
so he has to get us out of here.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.460
If he's going to get us out,

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.660
he has to give us some benefits, right?

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.500
Also,

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.060
Prince Zhao

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.540
has taken a liking to me

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.980
and wants to be brothers with me,

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.380
so he's being generous.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:36.780
What's so strange about that?

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.780
Right?

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.860
It makes sense.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:42.820
Jicai,

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.760
I don't think you need to be so nervous.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.660
We can discuss

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:46.840
whether we should go.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.020
But isn't it always written

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.500
like this in novels?

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.700
I'll give you five million

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.670
for you to leave my son.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.550
Would you agree?

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:55.870
Right?

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.430
It's possible that ancient

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.000
and modern nobles use the same methods.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:00.893
That makes sense.

00:39:00.993 --> 00:39:01.993
That makes sense.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.060
Don't TV shows also portray it this way?

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.420
If Prince Zhao introduces
a match for me,

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.700
we need to seriously consider it.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.220
Yangyang has been here for so long.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.680
She can't keep missing school.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.440
It's hard to choose a school
in the Capital,

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.740
but we can move somewhere else, right?

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.180
Let's think about it.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.440
But we need

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.830
to consider leaving Yunshui Manor.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.080
The engagement has been broken off.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.870
It's definitely not appropriate

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:26.680
for us to stay like this anymore.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.140
It makes sense.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.940

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.380
(This big sword made
of grilled skewers is edible.)

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:40.220
âªGranting us floods
strong enough to woundâª

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.020
âªEach other deeplyâª

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.980
âªFear one stroke wrong in time's flowâª

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.180
âªPassion fills the page,
leaving only foolish longingâª

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.860
âªFear sincerity trespassing half a stepâª

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:58.140
âªPlunging into thunder pools,
wholly drownedâª

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.220
âªFear fate's script
erasing this encounterâª

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.180
âªLaying celestial snares and thornsâª

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.540
âªThough glimpsing
a thread of forewarningâª

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.860
âªCan only lament too cruel a fateâª

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:18.660
âªKnowing destiny's course
defies reversalâª

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:24.980
âªYet forcing bonds
to confound heaven's willâª

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.140
âªSo be itâª

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:32.380
âªLet red threads tie our pledgeâª

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:37.060
âªThis covenant bonds
past and present livesâª

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.500
âªWholly depicts youâª

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.820
âªFear one stroke wrong in time's flowâª

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:46.140
âªPassion fills the page,
leaving only foolish longingâª

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.740
âªFear sincerity trespassing half a stepâª

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.900
âªPlunging into thunder pools,
wholly drownedâª

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:57.620
âªFear fate's script
erasing this encounterâª

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.060
âªLaying celestial snares and thornsâª

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.500
âªThough glimpsing
a thread of forewarningâª

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.820
âªCan only lamentâª

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:11.620
âªSuch a cruel affectionâª
