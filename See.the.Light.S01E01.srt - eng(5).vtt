00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.440
In a chaotic time and space,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.160
women can't be treated equally.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.520
A mysterious group appeared in the folk.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.400
[They carry on the women's code]

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.600
Like a meteor that slips through the night

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.080
It lights up the women in the deep mud.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.480
No one knows who they are

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.680
I only know they are from Shenhong Pawn Shop

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.000
Extra!

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.800
Extra!

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.560
Miss.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.160
Have we met before?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.880
You look like my cousin.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.400
No, you're prettier than her.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.160
You're much prettier than her.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.920
You're a beauty.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.400
That's you, right?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.560
What's your name?

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.479
Who are you?

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.480
From Anhui.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.320
Or where?

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.440
Let's have a chat if we're fated to meet.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.680
How many kids are there in your family?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.440
What do you want to eat?

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.520
I'll treat you to dinner.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.160
Miss,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.120
How about I buy you coffee?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.920
Let's watch a movie.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.480
Puppy, right?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.440
I'll buy you a cup of tea.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.720
Who are you?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.800
Chief Zhou Mu.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.280
Come with me.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.360
Stop bluffing.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.680
Don't force me to do it.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.520
Are you wearing a uniform?

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280
Don't bluff.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.680
You really want to fight?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.240
Come on.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.440
Don't move.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.840
Stop!

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.480
My arm hurts.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.120
What are you doing?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.640
You bumped into me. Apologize.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.200
Why aren't you looking at me?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.960
I don't care.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.840
Apologize!

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.360
Go ahead.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.720
Zhou Mu.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.600
Zhou Mu.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.960
It's you.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.880
How dare you come to the police station?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.680
What? You're a police officer.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.079
You don't have to apologize for hitting someone?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.720
You...

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.600
Like this.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.320
I'm sorry to hit you.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.520
Now,

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.960
give you some medical expenses.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.960
Go and see for yourself.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.760
I'm sorry.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.040
Mr. Zhou.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.040
Would you like to meet the director?

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.760
Go away. Are you done with the case?

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.880
You're a young master.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.800
No wonder he likes to hit people with money.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.960
Don't talk nonsense.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.920
I can sue you.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.120
Did I break the law?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.880
You...

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.440
I'm afraid of you.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.480
I'm sorry.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.520
Take the medical fee and check it out.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.560
I'm busy at work.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.080
Thank you.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.400
I'm not here to ask you for money.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.520
Qin Shan.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.120
She's the one who stopped me from catching Puppy.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.920
Ask them

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.640
about their relationship.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.120
and pay her for the medical bills.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.600
Yes.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.160
What are you doing?

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.959
You didn't apologize for bumping into me.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.320
I'm here to return something to you.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.160
You're talking about me?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.920
Miss,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.080
I have nothing to do with him.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.760
Please come here.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.720
Why do you detain me?

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.320
Why?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.080
Wang Yu.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.560
Jinjing.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.720
What? You know each other?

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.040
You guys go over there first.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.080
Okay, follow me.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.000
Let me see.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.240
What happened to your injury?

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.000
Where else?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.560
This...

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.560
Can you cooperate?

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.159
Pull down a little.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.080
Let me see inside.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.960
No need.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.800
It's not that I don't want to check.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.000
Isn't this supposed to be a policewoman?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.840
We don't have policemen here.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.760
Okay.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.080
Now we've checked the wound.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.880
And then?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.000
Then...

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.320
go back and tell your husband.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.680
Why call the police?

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.960
Next.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.920
This is domestic violence.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.440
Shouldn't you take care of her husband?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.280
What should we do

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.480
what should we do?

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.640
Look.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.840
She's badly injured.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.760
This is intentional injury.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.640
She can be convicted.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.040
Who knows if she fell by herself?

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.360
Either you find a witness

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.080
If you keep nagging here,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.440
I'll sue you for obstruction of justice.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.840
Fine.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.600
Zhou Mu.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.040
Zhou Mu.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.920
Zhou Mu.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.520
Stop shouting. This is the police station.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.880
This is the police station, right?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.280
We're here to report a case.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.720
She was already bullied.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.240
but you still bullied her.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.320
You didn't arrest him even though you have evidence.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.800
Why don't you just

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.720
instead of bullying the weak.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.480
Look at you.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.880
Who do you think is seeking justice for the people?

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.160
Don't worry.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.360
I'm different from them.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.920
You're different. You're just like them.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.920
In my place,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.120
I'll handle all major cases.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.720
Even if the Heavenly King comes, I'll still arrest him.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.600
Wang Yu, come home with me.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.520
We'll figure something out after we go back.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.880
Do you really trust that cop?

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.800
I think

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.800
he's different from other police officers.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.200
Forget it.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.800
Go somewhere with me.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.480
What is this?

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.680
When I was hit by Feng Lei,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.960
when I was hit by Feng Lei.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.480
I didn't believe in these tricks before.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.800
But now I want to give it a try.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.200
Do you really believe this?

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.440
The worse result

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.760
Can it be worse than now?

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.880
I'll kill you.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.640
How dare you!

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.920
How dare you disobey me!

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.600
I'll listen to you.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.720
Are you always lying to me?

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.880
Are you trying to lie to me?

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.440
How can I hit you if you don't make me angry?

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.880
Say something.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.720
If you marry me, you're mine.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.840
I'll do whatever I want.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.800
When will this day end?

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.560
This is it.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.440
Welcome to

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.840
Shenhong Pawn Shop

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.480
I need help.
