00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.799
Miss Lu.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.079
Who are you?

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.240
I am the master of this dream realm.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.280
This is my domain.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.799
Don't you wish to
be with your sister forever?

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.159
I can return her to you.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.799
She can stay with you forever.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:12.640
Tell me.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.000
What's your condition?

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.000
Talking terms with a clever person

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.439
is simple.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.879
You must stay here forever.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.760
Everything here

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.359
is nothing but a false dream.

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:29.840
What right do you have
to bargain with me?

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:33.400
You deceive humans,
trapping them in your dream.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:36.840
Do you really think
I'm that easy to fool?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.000
False?

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.000
Everything here may be an illusion,

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:44.640
but the warmth

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.079
feels so real.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.879
It's far better than that hypocritical,
broken world outside.

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:53.280
I once had a sister too.

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:56.319
But unlike you,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.719
my sister

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.640
enslaved me,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.079
destroyed me,

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.480
and for a few pieces of silver,

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.800
she made me please those filthy men.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.240
In some ways,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.599
I envy you a little.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.919
If I had a sister like yours,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.000
I wouldn't have needed
to create a world like this

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.800
to deceive myself.

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.680
But it doesn't matter.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.479
The warmth you once had,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.439
I will have it all in this world.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.240
And I'll keep you here forever

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.599
with me,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.599
until death.

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:47.120
I'll take your life right now.

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.919
You try to trap humans
in your dream realm,

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.960
but in truth,

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.479
you're the one who's trapped.

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.759
I just want them to stay with me.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.520
I want false happiness.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.360
I don't want lonely suffering.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.360
To keep the Lord of Wujian
trapped in the dream realm

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.560
is my greatest honor.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.319
Stay.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.319
Stay and share
this endless loneliness with me.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.439
Stay.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.680
Stay.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.240
Li Motong.

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:19.439
I don't need your protection.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:20.600
Stay.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.839
The demonic strings of this dream

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:27.160
will shatter you to pieces.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.680
Even so,

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.040
I don't want you to protect me.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.920
To die within the dream realm

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.639
or to live and leave it,

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.279
which will you choose?

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:47.319
(It's the Mei pearl.)

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.399
(The Mei pearl is inside her.)

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:55.079
(Li Motong,)

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.240
(Wujian will never let you go!)

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.920
(The Mei pearl truly lies within you.)

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:17.120

It's the Mei pearl.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.079
The Mei pearl has been awakened again.

Don't worry.

This is my home.

It's safe.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:27.680
What about your wounds?

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:32.310
Things from the dream realm

don't come into reality.

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.160
In the dream realm earlier,

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:39.240
we had to work together

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.040
to escape.

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:44.000
But it was your people
who killed my sister.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.000
I can never side with you.

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:48.439
Thanks.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:51.879
It's because of you

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:54.800
that we escaped the dream realm.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:56.560
Because of me?

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:00.279
(I can't let you get caught
in Wujian's conflict again.)

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:02.079
(I can't tell her.)

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:08.240
Nothing.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.040
As you said,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.680
it was good cooperation.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.639
Who are you, really?

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:19.360
I think we're friends.

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.959
We can't be friends.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.360
Next time we meet,

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:24.879
we'll be enemies.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.839
I'll never be your enemy.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.600
I'll protect you.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.879
I'll keep you safe from the demons.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.639
(Lanyue,)

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.759
(our fate was unfinished
in the past life,)

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.120
(this life I'll protect you completely.)

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.080
The Mei pearl's power
destroyed the dream disc.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.679
It seems their destined fate
cannot be escaped.

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:01.120
According to Wujian's rules,

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:03.440
once the Mei pearl reappears,
it must return to Wujian.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:06.720
What do you intend to do?

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.639
I'll kill her

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.320
and take back the Mei pearl.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.919
Killing a human being.

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:14.639
Do you wish to face heavenly punishment?

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.559
The order of Wujian cannot be broken.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.200
We

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.639
cannot interfere
with human life and death at will.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.120
Moreover,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.240
the Mei pearl must be handled
by Li Motong himself.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.559
Even without breaking Wujian's law,

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:32.440
the Mei pearl
must still return to Wujian.

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:34.480
Don't worry.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.960
I'll find a way.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.559
Wait for my good news.

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:46.279
