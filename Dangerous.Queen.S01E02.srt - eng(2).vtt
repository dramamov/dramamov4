00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:40.152
Why are you dressed like this?

00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:42.108
Today was Dad’s cremation, Mom.

00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:43.686
You didn’t even go.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.622
But made me celebrate someone else instead.

00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:47.071
Wasin is not someone else.

00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:48.374
He’s my husband.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.506
I’m begging you.

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:51.414
Please, don’t gamble anymore.

00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:53.632
I don’t know how I can keep finding money for you anymore.

00:01:53.632 --> 00:01:54.345
Bo!

00:01:54.345 --> 00:01:55.463
I’m your mother.

00:01:55.463 --> 00:01:57.596
Your damn job is to bring me money!

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.251
Bo!

00:02:06.312 --> 00:02:07.934
I told you to come read me the news.

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:09.245
We called them over.

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:11.280
Not just for you, you know!

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.579
But she’ll serve only me.

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:14.588
Come here.

00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:26.602
Pakinn, you screwed up the whole night!

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:29.118
Damn it!

00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:34.378
What’s your problem?!

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:35.663
It’s just one girl!

00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:55.248
I’ll go check on him.

00:02:56.804 --> 00:02:58.454
Damn it, Pakinn!

00:02:59.285 --> 00:03:00.247
I think it’s settled.

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:01.191
Just get back to work.

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:10.898
Why are you still standing?

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:13.215
Come read me the news.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.754
Yes.

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.204
Thank you for helping me.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.230
I did nothing.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.287
Just start reading.

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:48.595
Yes.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.117
Here’s water for everyone.

00:05:16.213 --> 00:05:17.814
Hurry up!

00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:23.419
Thank you so much.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.016
What is this?!

00:05:34.486 --> 00:05:35.682
I’m totally broke!

00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:41.927
Kem.

00:05:42.424 --> 00:05:43.774
Lend me some cash.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.414
I just gave it to you!

00:05:47.355 --> 00:05:48.499
I blew it all already.

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:49.637
And Bo hasn’t come back yet.

00:05:49.637 --> 00:05:50.936
Where am I supposed to get more cash?!

00:05:50.936 --> 00:05:51.638
What?!

00:05:51.638 --> 00:05:53.080
Bo hasn’t come back yet?!

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.232
It’s almost midnight already!

00:05:55.232 --> 00:05:56.161
Why hasn’t Bo come back yet?!

00:05:56.161 --> 00:05:57.291
How would I know?!

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:59.387
Just give me some cash, I need to keep playing.

00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:03.943
This is all I’ve got.

00:06:07.426 --> 00:06:08.674
You’re such a savior!

00:06:08.674 --> 00:06:09.673
Thanks a lot!

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.111
I’m back!

00:06:40.052 --> 00:06:40.962
Bo!

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:42.242
Kem!

00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:43.209
What’s up?

00:06:44.815 --> 00:06:45.959
Nothing.

00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:49.351
It’s just that Bua told me you weren’t home yet.

00:06:51.172 --> 00:06:52.783
I just got off work at the club.

00:06:53.135 --> 00:06:54.094
I’m exhausted!

00:06:54.094 --> 00:06:54.753
What?!

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.097
You’re working at a club?!

00:06:59.432 --> 00:07:01.121
I need to make extra money.

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:02.734
I still haven’t paid my tuition yet.

00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:09.029
But…

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:10.572
It’s risky, Bo.

00:07:11.325 --> 00:07:12.599
You’re a woman.

00:07:13.063 --> 00:07:14.337
So what if I’m a woman?

00:07:14.337 --> 00:07:16.143
Can’t a woman work too?!

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.665
This kind of work is dangerous, Bo.

00:07:18.665 --> 00:07:20.564
Men can’t be trusted.

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:21.988
Bo.

00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:24.028
Use my money for your tuition first, okay?

00:07:25.143 --> 00:07:26.806
I haven’t finished paying you back yet.

00:07:26.806 --> 00:07:28.151
How could I borrow more?

00:07:28.583 --> 00:07:31.880
I’m working because I want to be able to take care of myself.

00:07:36.049 --> 00:07:37.634
Then, if that’s what you want.

00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:39.815
It’s not like you would listen to me anyway.

00:07:39.815 --> 00:07:41.418
I’m just worried about you.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.992
I know.

00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:44.260
That’s why I’m telling you.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.318
Don’t worry.

00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:50.617
I’m leaving.

00:07:51.794 --> 00:07:53.353
Where are you going? Not even waiting for me?

00:07:53.353 --> 00:07:54.562
I’ll walk you there.

00:07:54.815 --> 00:07:55.855
It’ll be a mess if you get lost.

00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:57.732
My house is just right here!

00:07:59.536 --> 00:08:00.861
Just don’t want you to get lost.

00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:40.139
I saw the light was still on.

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:42.122
Just as I thought, you’re still awake.

00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:44.814
I’m still reading the news.

00:08:46.745 --> 00:08:50.328
I think you should get someone to help read the news.

00:08:50.636 --> 00:08:52.481
They can summarize it for you.

00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:54.439
So you can relax a little more.

00:08:55.082 --> 00:08:56.045
That’s a good idea.

00:08:57.127 --> 00:08:59.568
I just had someone read me the news at the club today.

00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:02.140
Someone from the club?

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.730
And you’re already back to work at home?!

00:09:07.365 --> 00:09:09.132
That’s definitely my little sister.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.606
King!

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.562
I’ve found a site that looks interesting.

00:09:15.963 --> 00:09:17.418
That’s enough, Queen.

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:20.057
We’ll talk about work tomorrow.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.710
For now, you’re going to bed.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.872
Trust me.

00:09:23.872 --> 00:09:25.380
Come on, go to bed.

00:09:28.215 --> 00:09:29.463
Go to bed.

00:09:35.514 --> 00:09:36.580
Turn off the lights for me then.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.249
Mmm.

00:09:46.459 --> 00:09:48.122
Go to bed.

00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:22.036
It’s definitely going to rain.

00:10:22.036 --> 00:10:23.074
Bo!

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:24.924
Kem!

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.778
You’re heading to class?

00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:29.509
Mmm.

00:10:30.708 --> 00:10:32.708
I got you some congee. Have a little before you go?

00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:34.537
Thanks a lot.

00:10:34.537 --> 00:10:35.969
But I don’t think I can.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.270
The rain’s coming.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.414
Then…

00:10:40.084 --> 00:10:41.435
You can take my umbrella.

00:10:44.517 --> 00:10:45.635
It’s alright.

00:10:45.635 --> 00:10:46.589
I’d better run.

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:47.764
I don’t want to get stuck in traffic, too.

00:10:47.764 --> 00:10:48.639
See you!

00:11:43.144 --> 00:11:44.392
So, she’s still studying.

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:00.543
Get in.

00:12:06.463 --> 00:12:07.444
Are you talking to me?

00:12:09.363 --> 00:12:10.325
Just get in.

00:12:11.257 --> 00:12:12.505
Why should I get in?

00:12:14.127 --> 00:12:15.349
Look at your shirt.

00:12:20.722 --> 00:12:21.684
Get in.

00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:26.997
It’s alright, I don’t want to trouble you.

00:12:26.997 --> 00:12:28.303
I’m all wet.

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:31.711
I’ll pay you.

00:12:32.555 --> 00:12:33.774
Get in the car with me.

00:12:33.774 --> 00:12:35.192
How much do you want?

00:12:35.786 --> 00:12:37.578
I don’t do that kind of work.

00:12:38.993 --> 00:12:40.811
I’m paying you to get in my car.

00:12:41.577 --> 00:12:43.084
Not to sleep with me.

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:48.912
Get in.

00:12:49.815 --> 00:12:51.633
I don’t like being the center of attention.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.530
I didn’t get in the car because you said you’d pay me.

00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:25.680
You’re cold?

00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:28.408
There’s a jacket in the back.

00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:30.224
Put it on.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.750
It’s alright, I don’t want to trouble you.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.727
Do I have to pay you to wear the jacket too, Babe?

00:14:10.415 --> 00:14:12.493
It’s expensive, I wouldn’t dare wear it.

00:14:13.536 --> 00:14:14.814
Just put it on.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.332
It’s too expensive.

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.177
I told you to wear the jacket.

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:22.409
Not to buy it from me.

00:14:27.604 --> 00:14:29.814
Or do you want to sit in front of me like this, all see-through?

00:14:38.705 --> 00:14:40.446
It’s not like I wanted to look that much.

00:14:41.632 --> 00:14:43.418
But I saw you looking.

00:14:49.401 --> 00:14:51.116
So, where are you heading?

00:14:51.988 --> 00:14:53.484
I’m going to work at the club.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.480
The place where I met you last night?

00:14:59.578 --> 00:15:00.722
Yes.

00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:03.149
You can drop me off up ahead.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.938
I’ll take you there.

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.324
I have something to do around there anyway.

00:15:49.277 --> 00:15:50.324
Thank you for the ride.

00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:51.824
I should get to work now.

00:15:52.055 --> 00:15:52.957
Take the jacket.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.090
It’s your pay for getting in my car.

00:15:58.178 --> 00:15:59.038
I won’t take it.

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:02.240
What should you do if an elder gives you something?

00:16:48.542 --> 00:16:50.542
So, I heard you’re getting into politics.

00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:55.481
I don’t think so.

00:16:56.076 --> 00:16:58.076
Didn’t you have someone following me the other day?

00:17:00.398 --> 00:17:01.859
You’re overthinking, Queen.

00:17:02.335 --> 00:17:04.335
Who’d ever do that to an old friend?

00:17:06.884 --> 00:17:08.884
But if you really are getting into politics.

00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:11.175
That’s unfortunate for you.

00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:13.875
To have me as your rival.

00:17:19.188 --> 00:17:21.188
I want a rival worthy of me.

00:17:22.842 --> 00:17:24.531
Not some coward lurking in the shadows.

00:17:26.066 --> 00:17:27.693
At the very least.

00:17:28.696 --> 00:17:30.696
Have a decent reputation.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.435
And besides.

00:17:39.181 --> 00:17:41.181
I haven’t agreed to anything yet.

00:17:42.218 --> 00:17:44.777
Why are you getting all worked up, Kongtup?

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.771
Are you afraid?

00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:53.678
Don’t get ahead of yourself, Queen.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.580
Bo!

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.235
Leave it, I’m going in.

00:18:45.442 --> 00:18:47.031
Back home at dawn again, Mom.

00:18:47.031 --> 00:18:49.302
That’s right! My luck is rising!

00:18:49.302 --> 00:18:51.725
Look! I’m going to be rich!

00:18:52.036 --> 00:18:54.666
After my shower, I’m going back for more.

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.787
I’ll go in big today.

00:18:56.787 --> 00:18:58.857
My luck’s turning!

00:18:58.857 --> 00:19:00.309
I’ll be rich in no time!

00:19:02.351 --> 00:19:03.584
Why would you go back again, Mom?

00:19:03.584 --> 00:19:05.317
I think it’s better if you save the money.

00:19:05.525 --> 00:19:07.525
Bo! You don’t know a thing!

00:19:07.525 --> 00:19:11.239
That’s how it works, you win, you put more in.

00:19:11.239 --> 00:19:13.254
That’s how you’ll get more money.

00:19:13.643 --> 00:19:15.228
You won this time.

00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:16.664
But next time you might lose it all.

00:19:17.654 --> 00:19:19.219
What did you just say?!

00:19:19.219 --> 00:19:20.924
You said I would lose it all?!

00:19:20.924 --> 00:19:22.843
Did you just curse me, Bo?!

00:19:22.843 --> 00:19:24.609
How dare you?! How dare you curse me like that?!

00:19:25.119 --> 00:19:26.497
Watch your mouth!

00:19:28.454 --> 00:19:30.164
You don’t like it when I’m in a good mood, do you?!

00:19:30.164 --> 00:19:31.551
You like making me angry, don’t you?!

00:19:31.551 --> 00:19:32.938
You like getting yourself hurt, don’t you?!

00:19:33.198 --> 00:19:35.012
Fine! If that’s what you want!

00:19:40.631 --> 00:19:41.533
Big mouth, huh?!

00:19:44.848 --> 00:19:46.641
I’ll take every last bit of your money.

00:19:46.641 --> 00:19:48.575
Won’t leave you a single cent.

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:50.543
Ungrateful daughter!

00:19:50.543 --> 00:19:51.360
Take it back!

00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.958
Forget the shower, I’m pissed off!

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.431
Good morning, Queen.

00:20:34.989 --> 00:20:35.849
What is it?

00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:38.176
I heard you’re presenting a new site.

00:20:41.662 --> 00:20:42.709
And?

00:20:43.362 --> 00:20:44.761
It’s really just pointless.

00:20:45.609 --> 00:20:47.298
It won’t change anything.

00:20:48.368 --> 00:20:50.099
I don't want you to tire yourself out for nothing.

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:54.318
Nothing is ever pointless.

00:20:58.497 --> 00:21:00.497
Why don’t you wait to see my proposal first?

00:21:01.338 --> 00:21:03.338
Then make your objections.

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:18.133
Just a word of advice.

00:21:19.024 --> 00:21:21.024
You’d better not go around making enemies.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.550
Especially not within the same company.

00:21:25.883 --> 00:21:27.261
That can be scary.

00:21:42.452 --> 00:21:44.183
Keep watching.

00:21:48.087 --> 00:21:50.087
If anything happens, call me immediately.

00:21:57.924 --> 00:21:59.033
Is something wrong?

00:21:59.695 --> 00:22:01.175
It’s about Queen.

00:22:02.993 --> 00:22:04.289
I’m worried about her.

00:22:04.971 --> 00:22:07.655
The company is a dangerous place, full of ruthless people.

00:22:07.655 --> 00:22:10.499
I wish she would just leave it all behind and stay with us.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.943
Take it easy.

00:22:13.246 --> 00:22:14.231
Just give her some time.

00:22:14.645 --> 00:22:16.334
It’s been ten years.

00:22:17.422 --> 00:22:18.842
So what if it has?

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:21.711
Queen still hasn’t accepted me.

00:22:24.444 --> 00:22:25.967
Just take it slow.

00:22:26.481 --> 00:22:28.667
I believe Queen can handle it well.

00:23:01.709 --> 00:23:02.569
Bo.

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:05.231
Are you sure you’re okay?

00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:09.849
I think so.

00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:13.147
Thanks, Mint.

00:23:14.873 --> 00:23:18.137
A friend like me doesn’t come around often, you know.

00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:20.839
Let me see your face.

00:23:25.218 --> 00:23:26.721
Did you really cover up your bruises?

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:29.408
Yes.

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.248
Why?

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:32.140
Come here.

00:23:42.201 --> 00:23:43.289
That hurts, Mint!

00:23:43.289 --> 00:23:44.444
Be gentle!

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:46.888
Sorry, I was a bit rough.

00:23:49.797 --> 00:23:50.906
I’ll do it myself.

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:54.479
I’m definitely catching a cold.

00:23:56.921 --> 00:23:59.791
Guess you’re calling in sick tonight.

00:24:00.802 --> 00:24:02.636
I already called Fern and took the night off.

00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:04.097
What?!

00:24:04.484 --> 00:24:05.717
When did you call?

00:24:06.176 --> 00:24:07.326
Last night.

00:24:08.355 --> 00:24:09.692
And you told me nothing?!

00:24:13.307 --> 00:24:15.121
Why don’t you take the night off too?

00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:17.140
I can’t.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.664
I have to go to work.

00:24:19.154 --> 00:24:21.154
I don’t have a single cent on me right now.

00:24:23.398 --> 00:24:24.403
Is it fully covered?

00:24:32.937 --> 00:24:34.129
Come on, Cheers!

00:24:34.129 --> 00:24:34.743
Cheers!

00:24:34.743 --> 00:24:36.031
You can sure drink a lot!

00:24:37.896 --> 00:24:39.212
We’re here to drink, aren’t we?

00:24:40.561 --> 00:24:42.105
Anyone up for a game?

00:24:42.105 --> 00:24:44.005
Let’s make a little bet for fun.

00:24:44.005 --> 00:24:46.212
You really want to play now?

00:24:46.212 --> 00:24:48.910
It’s so dark, I can’t see a thing.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.862
Maybe it’s just your eyes, huh?

00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:53.999
Let’s get started…

00:24:58.703 --> 00:24:59.771
What are you doing?!

00:24:59.771 --> 00:25:01.025
I’m soaked!

00:25:03.284 --> 00:25:04.559
I’m so sorry.

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:06.545
I will clean it up right away.

00:25:27.553 --> 00:25:28.783
I’m so sorry.

00:25:28.783 --> 00:25:30.788
I will clean it up right away.

00:25:39.725 --> 00:25:40.450
Bie!

00:25:42.485 --> 00:25:43.320
Get up.

00:25:44.865 --> 00:25:47.239
I am very sorry, may I ask what happened?

00:25:47.239 --> 00:25:48.763
She spilled the drink on me!

00:25:48.763 --> 00:25:50.493
Throw her out right now!

00:25:51.893 --> 00:25:53.796
Of course, I will handle it right away.

00:25:53.796 --> 00:25:54.598
Come on, Bie.

00:25:55.628 --> 00:25:56.616
I’m truly sorry.

00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:58.202
You!

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:13.300
I sincerely apologize.

00:26:14.217 --> 00:26:15.359
Let’s go.

00:26:17.572 --> 00:26:20.803
I’ll never set foot in this crappy club again!

00:26:23.368 --> 00:26:24.636
Are you okay?

00:26:26.145 --> 00:26:27.046
I’m fine.

00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:29.355
Alright then…

00:26:29.637 --> 00:26:30.823
Let’s go have some fun.

00:26:30.823 --> 00:26:31.807
I got us our usual table.

00:26:31.807 --> 00:26:32.569
Let’s go.

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:34.818
I’ll go to the restroom first.

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:40.327
Okay, sure.

00:27:08.412 --> 00:27:09.510
What’s wrong?

00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:12.854
Nothing.

00:27:12.854 --> 00:27:13.926
I’m fine.

00:27:29.368 --> 00:27:30.730
Who did this to you?

00:27:37.206 --> 00:27:38.854
I’m really fine.

00:28:00.362 --> 00:28:01.922
Please, just let me go.

00:28:50.201 --> 00:28:51.475
Why are you crying?

00:28:55.826 --> 00:28:56.639
Queen.

00:28:58.715 --> 00:28:59.879
You haven’t left?

00:29:04.391 --> 00:29:06.391
I asked, why are you crying?

00:29:07.938 --> 00:29:09.636
Who did this to you?

00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:13.373
It’s nothing.

00:29:16.386 --> 00:29:17.133
Babe.

00:29:21.411 --> 00:29:22.839
It really is nothing.

00:29:32.472 --> 00:29:34.472
Please, don’t push me.

00:29:35.367 --> 00:29:36.839
I don’t want to talk about it.

00:29:40.866 --> 00:29:42.602
I don’t like seeing people cry.

00:29:44.777 --> 00:29:45.963
It irritates me.

00:29:46.563 --> 00:29:48.563
I didn’t mean for you to see me cry.

00:29:49.198 --> 00:29:50.824
So, I’m intruding?

00:29:53.046 --> 00:29:54.012
No.

00:29:54.841 --> 00:29:56.269
Please, excuse me.

00:29:57.716 --> 00:29:58.792
Where are you going?

00:29:59.175 --> 00:30:00.054
Home.

00:30:06.772 --> 00:30:08.178
How are you getting back?

00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:12.817
My friend’s picking me up.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.008
An elder’s speaking to you.

00:30:21.214 --> 00:30:22.904
You should turn around and answer properly.

00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:26.037
Why are you so bossy?

00:30:35.106 --> 00:30:36.182
I’m sorry.

00:30:38.254 --> 00:30:40.254
I’m feeling unsteady right now.

00:30:41.164 --> 00:30:43.164
If I said something I shouldn’t have…

00:30:45.005 --> 00:30:46.257
I’m truly sorry.

00:31:00.653 --> 00:31:02.103
Has your friend arrived?

00:31:11.728 --> 00:31:13.134
Go wait in my car.

00:31:23.126 --> 00:31:26.533
Don’t make me pay you to get in the car a second time, Babe.

00:31:57.154 --> 00:31:58.428
Why are you staring at me?

00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:01.731
I just don’t understand.

00:32:03.474 --> 00:32:04.924
What do you want from me?

00:32:07.927 --> 00:32:09.399
What do I want from you?

00:32:10.822 --> 00:32:11.503
Yes.

00:32:13.156 --> 00:32:15.024
Why are you doing all this?

00:32:16.732 --> 00:32:18.358
Is my misery...

00:32:19.247 --> 00:32:20.565
fun to you?

00:32:24.093 --> 00:32:26.093
I only see you as a little sister.

00:32:41.918 --> 00:32:42.836
Hello.

00:32:43.334 --> 00:32:44.476
Where are you, Queen?

00:32:46.017 --> 00:32:47.156
I’m outside.

00:32:48.706 --> 00:32:50.002
Is there anything you need, Mom?

00:32:50.554 --> 00:32:52.840
Wasin and I need to talk to you.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.422
Could you come by?

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.436
I’m busy right now.

00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:00.190
(Queen.)

00:33:01.651 --> 00:33:03.035
(Do it for me.)

00:33:12.104 --> 00:33:12.829
Alright.

00:33:14.241 --> 00:33:15.581
I’ll come by.

00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:19.916
You’d better go.

00:33:20.381 --> 00:33:21.633
Please, excuse me.

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:23.565
When is your friend coming?

00:33:30.329 --> 00:33:31.669
(What now, Bo?!)

00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:33.385
(No one’s actually coming!)

00:33:35.404 --> 00:33:37.536
Don’t make a habit of lying.

00:33:44.051 --> 00:33:44.930
Tell me.

00:33:46.332 --> 00:33:48.134
Where do you want me to drop you off?

00:33:50.478 --> 00:33:52.588
Does dropping me off make you feel good?

00:33:56.354 --> 00:33:58.068
What are you so angry at me for?

00:34:00.531 --> 00:34:01.388
Nothing.

00:34:02.777 --> 00:34:05.085
But you’re getting too involved in my life.

00:34:08.583 --> 00:34:09.416
Fine.

00:34:11.165 --> 00:34:13.011
I’ll stay out of your life from now on.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.216
Was that too harsh?

00:34:45.707 --> 00:34:46.652
Whatever.

00:34:50.302 --> 00:34:50.895
Queen.

00:34:51.817 --> 00:34:52.915
Yes, Queen?

00:34:53.284 --> 00:34:54.141
(Follow her.)

00:34:55.257 --> 00:34:56.531
(See that she gets home.)

00:34:57.746 --> 00:34:58.932
Got it.

00:35:07.421 --> 00:35:08.497
That mouth of yours!

00:35:08.607 --> 00:35:10.531
How dare you curse me, Bo?!

00:35:12.313 --> 00:35:14.115
I’m hurt! Mom!

00:35:14.115 --> 00:35:15.867
I’m drowning in debt because of you!

00:35:15.867 --> 00:35:16.592
I’m hurt!

00:35:16.592 --> 00:35:18.280
You have to pay it back!

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.022
I’ve sold you to the gambling den!

00:35:22.452 --> 00:35:23.287
What did you say?

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:24.727
I’ve already sold you to the gambling den.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.802
You’ll have to pay off my debt.

00:35:29.637 --> 00:35:30.304
No, Mom.

00:35:30.304 --> 00:35:31.012
I’m not going.

00:35:31.012 --> 00:35:31.839
You are!

00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:33.234
They're coming for you tomorrow.

00:35:33.234 --> 00:35:34.374
I've already sold you.

00:35:37.786 --> 00:35:39.522
How could you do this to me, Mom?

00:35:40.894 --> 00:35:43.114
You have to repay me, Bo!

00:35:48.755 --> 00:35:49.636
I’m not going.

00:35:50.134 --> 00:35:51.057
You are.

00:35:51.637 --> 00:35:52.801
What am I to you, Mom?!

00:35:53.747 --> 00:35:54.933
How dare you talk back to me?

00:35:54.933 --> 00:35:56.787
How dare you disobey me, Bo?!

00:35:56.787 --> 00:35:57.760
You’re going!

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.730
I’m not going!

00:35:59.417 --> 00:36:00.999
I'll beat you to death!

00:36:04.077 --> 00:36:05.065
Let me go!

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.476
It’s me, Bo.

00:36:45.878 --> 00:36:46.957
Take a sip first.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.995
Mmm.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.093
Does it hurt a lot, Bo?

00:37:00.253 --> 00:37:01.297
No.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.710
Thanks for helping me.

00:37:04.361 --> 00:37:06.361
It’s okay, don’t make it a big deal.

00:37:11.872 --> 00:37:12.916
Kem.

00:37:13.449 --> 00:37:15.807
Mom sold me off to the gambling den to pay off her debts.

00:37:16.635 --> 00:37:18.137
I can’t take this anymore.

00:37:18.413 --> 00:37:19.917
I don’t want to stay here.

00:37:21.671 --> 00:37:22.397
Bo.

00:37:22.397 --> 00:37:23.857
Don’t think too much about it.

00:37:25.847 --> 00:37:26.957
I…

00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:31.437
I’ve already paid off Bua’s debt.

00:37:36.459 --> 00:37:38.140
My luck’s crap!

00:37:39.513 --> 00:37:41.215
What’s the rush?

00:37:42.259 --> 00:37:43.980
Big Boss sent me to ask.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.929
When will you pay your debt?

00:37:45.929 --> 00:37:47.447
I’ll pay when I have the money.

00:37:47.447 --> 00:37:48.253
Can’t you see that?

00:37:48.253 --> 00:37:49.711
I’m completely broke.

00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:50.478
Hey!

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.803
But Big Boss said…

00:37:53.803 --> 00:37:55.747
If you still don’t have the money.

00:37:55.747 --> 00:37:57.423
Don’t bother showing your face here again.

00:37:58.445 --> 00:37:59.430
What?!

00:37:59.579 --> 00:38:01.579
You've got until the end of this month.

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:04.785
Or Big Boss will go claim your house.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.245
What is this?!

00:38:07.245 --> 00:38:09.543
You won’t let me come here, so where am I supposed to get the money?

00:38:09.543 --> 00:38:10.614
That’s 200,000!

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.471
That’s your problem.

00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:20.584
Damn Bo!

00:38:22.341 --> 00:38:23.286
Bo!

00:38:24.504 --> 00:38:25.867
I’ll sell my daughter.

00:38:27.788 --> 00:38:29.509
She’ll take on my debts.

00:38:29.509 --> 00:38:30.871
Go tell your Big Boss.

00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:32.534
Make her your wife, or do whatever you want with her.

00:38:32.534 --> 00:38:33.774
That’s up to your Big Boss.

00:38:34.387 --> 00:38:36.228
That’s a tempting offer.

00:38:37.447 --> 00:38:41.199
Then bring your daughter to meet Big Boss.

00:38:41.777 --> 00:38:43.777
Let’s see how much she’s worth.

00:38:44.906 --> 00:38:45.751
Fine!

00:38:52.089 --> 00:38:54.089
Seksan!

00:38:54.797 --> 00:38:55.797
What do you want?

00:38:57.076 --> 00:38:58.817
How much does Bua owe Big Boss?

00:39:01.068 --> 00:39:01.957
Why?

00:39:01.957 --> 00:39:03.443
You’re going to pay it off?

00:39:05.984 --> 00:39:06.677
Yes.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.131
You’ve got guts!

00:39:13.289 --> 00:39:15.767
But someone like you...

00:39:16.192 --> 00:39:18.630
Where would you ever find that much money?

00:39:21.735 --> 00:39:23.037
I just have it.

00:39:24.023 --> 00:39:25.525
So how much is it?

00:39:30.127 --> 00:39:31.012
200,000.

00:39:38.637 --> 00:39:39.542
What?!

00:39:40.001 --> 00:39:42.517
Why would you pay that much for my mom?!

00:39:44.019 --> 00:39:45.378
And where did you get all that money?!

00:39:46.843 --> 00:39:47.867
Well…

00:39:48.307 --> 00:39:50.845
I had some savings set aside for my parents.

00:39:50.845 --> 00:39:52.765
But you don’t have to worry at all.

00:39:53.097 --> 00:39:55.097
And you don’t have to pay me back.

00:39:55.097 --> 00:39:56.546
I’m glad to help.

00:39:59.573 --> 00:40:01.314
I really don’t understand.

00:40:01.314 --> 00:40:03.318
Why would you go this far for me?

00:40:13.957 --> 00:40:15.280
I’d do anything for you.

00:40:18.852 --> 00:40:20.553
I want to take care of you, Bo.

00:40:26.795 --> 00:40:27.541
Bo.

00:40:34.408 --> 00:40:35.672
I love you.

00:40:36.025 --> 00:40:37.468
Will you be my girlfriend?

00:40:45.293 --> 00:40:46.875
We’re friends, Kem.

00:40:47.726 --> 00:40:48.531
Bo!

00:40:48.795 --> 00:40:49.979
Bo, wait!

00:40:49.979 --> 00:40:52.087
Bo! Please, wait!

00:40:52.087 --> 00:40:53.090
Bo!

00:40:54.989 --> 00:40:55.874
Bo.

00:40:56.406 --> 00:40:57.829
Can you give me a chance, Bo?

00:41:00.308 --> 00:41:02.308
It's not about giving chances.

00:41:02.806 --> 00:41:04.348
But it’s about feelings.

00:41:04.802 --> 00:41:06.245
I do love you, Kem.

00:41:06.245 --> 00:41:08.039
But I love you as a friend.

00:41:09.225 --> 00:41:11.225
And I've never felt more than that.

00:41:15.152 --> 00:41:15.918
Bo.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.251
Can you open up to me, Bo?

00:41:19.251 --> 00:41:20.357
Please.

00:41:21.747 --> 00:41:22.433
Bo.

00:41:25.822 --> 00:41:28.459
Everything I've done, I did it all for you.

00:41:29.583 --> 00:41:31.364
I’ve worked so hard.

00:41:31.364 --> 00:41:33.773
Because I want to build a life with you.

00:41:34.953 --> 00:41:36.953
I thought that one day, when I was ready…

00:41:36.953 --> 00:41:38.968
I’d tell you how I feel.

00:41:39.813 --> 00:41:40.559
Bo.

00:41:41.078 --> 00:41:43.078
But why does it seem like…

00:41:44.978 --> 00:41:47.378
You've never seen how much love I have for you?

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:52.168
Please don't make this any harder than it already is, Kem.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.690
Everything you've done for me.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.784
I truly appreciate it.

00:41:57.869 --> 00:41:59.491
But what you just said.

00:42:01.354 --> 00:42:02.637
I really can’t do it.

00:42:02.849 --> 00:42:04.849
Bo!

00:42:05.712 --> 00:42:07.712
Please, Bo, I’m begging you.

00:42:07.712 --> 00:42:08.565
If, in the end…

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.602
If you’re not happy.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.361
I’ll step back myself.

00:42:16.361 --> 00:42:18.505
Please, Bo, just give me a chance.

00:42:18.505 --> 00:42:20.783
Please stop, Kem. I can only be your friend.

00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:22.917
Bo!

00:42:23.718 --> 00:42:25.459
Bo!

00:42:26.593 --> 00:42:27.577
Why, Bo?

00:42:27.577 --> 00:42:28.970
Why am I not good enough?

00:42:29.664 --> 00:42:31.107
Or what am I missing?

00:42:36.699 --> 00:42:37.504
Or…

00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:39.902
Because I'm not rich?

00:42:41.842 --> 00:42:43.902
You think I can’t take care of you, right?!

00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:46.773
I can take care of you, Bo!

00:42:52.765 --> 00:42:53.471
Or…

00:42:56.348 --> 00:42:57.591
You like rich people?

00:43:03.273 --> 00:43:04.238
Right!

00:43:04.238 --> 00:43:05.515
Because I'm not rich, am I?!

00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:09.164
And what if it is, Kem?

00:43:09.789 --> 00:43:12.818
If I want money, if I want a better life, what then, Kem?!

00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:15.593
And more importantly…

00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:18.249
I wouldn't have to rely on anyone like this.

00:43:18.249 --> 00:43:19.467
It’s pathetic.

00:43:28.077 --> 00:43:29.779
How could you do this to me, Kem?!

00:43:31.088 --> 00:43:31.834
Bo.

00:43:31.834 --> 00:43:33.640
I’m sorry, Bo.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.070
I’m so sorry, Bo.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.501
I didn’t mean to do that, Bo.

00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:37.854
Please, Bo, I’m so sorry.

00:43:37.854 --> 00:43:40.027
You can hit me, Bo! Hit me!

00:43:40.027 --> 00:43:41.128
Please, just hit me!

00:43:41.244 --> 00:43:42.089
Stop!

00:43:49.094 --> 00:43:49.880
I…

00:43:51.958 --> 00:43:53.122
I have to go.

00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:23.554
How much is it for a massage?

00:44:23.554 --> 00:44:24.553
I won’t charge.

00:44:24.553 --> 00:44:26.151
What if I like it?

00:44:30.585 --> 00:44:31.957
I booked this girl for the night.

00:44:31.957 --> 00:44:32.991
But I'll let you have her.

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:34.601
Even if I tell you.

00:44:34.601 --> 00:44:35.808
You wouldn’t be able to help me anyway.

00:44:36.311 --> 00:44:37.495
If you want my help.

00:44:37.495 --> 00:44:38.662
Just say it.

00:44:38.662 --> 00:44:42.370
I know you’ve had a crush on Bo since forever.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:43.740
Why don’t you just make Bo your wife?

00:44:44.507 --> 00:44:45.492
So…

00:44:45.492 --> 00:44:47.368
Bo really is just after money.

00:44:50.056 --> 00:44:50.762
Babe.

00:44:50.762 --> 00:44:52.017
If I were to kiss you…

00:44:52.017 --> 00:44:53.409
How much would it cost me?
