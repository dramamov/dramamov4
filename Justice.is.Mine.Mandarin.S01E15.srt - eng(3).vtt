00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.400
Judge Qin.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.433
Judge Qin!

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.333
Judge Qin!

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.400
Hang in there!

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:39.933
I'm in the courthouse parking lot.

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:41.766
Someone has been shot. Send someone now!

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.333
Judge Qin!

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.733
(Justice is Mine)

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.733
(Episode 15)

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:23.033
Tang Xuan.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:25.766
- Officer Hu. - What's the situation?

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:27.266
Judge Qin was shot in the lung.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600
There was massive bleeding.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.066
It was a motorcycle again.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.466
It's the same method that Ma Shan Bao was killed.

00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:34.133
It must be the Han family again.

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:38.233
Are you okay?

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:42.366
I'm fine.

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:44.566
Go home and get some rest.

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:46.333
I'll take care of this case.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.866
Madam, I'll take you home first.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:51.333
I'll bring you back here later.

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.033
The boss and I will stay at the hospital.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.966
I'll notify you as soon as Judge Qin wakes up.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.933
Go on. Hurry.

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:02.366
Take care of Madam.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400
Yes, sir.

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:06.366
Boss.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:12.666
His heart rate is dropping rapidly.

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:14.800
The patient is in cardiac arrest.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:16.633
Prepare the defibrillator.

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:17.800
1mg of epinephrine.

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.033
1mg of epinephrine is ready.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.833
The defibrillator is ready.

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:37.166
Dad.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400
Are you still sleeping?

00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:44.533
Dad.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:45.833
There's food.

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:47.933
Mom prepared a lot of food.

00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:50.866
Dad is still sleeping.

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.000
Don't wake him up.

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:55.565
Let him sleep.

00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:57.133
Dad, aren't you coming?

00:03:57.433 --> 00:03:58.833
Be careful.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.666
- Of what? - I'll throw this ball at you.

00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:09.033
Are you still sleeping?

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:45.266
You're awake.

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:47.033
What's your name?

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:50.333
Qin Yu.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.533
Do you know where you are?

00:04:55.533 --> 00:04:56.533
The hospital.

00:04:57.733 --> 00:04:59.366
Try raising your right hand.

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:04.733
Good. Very good.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.800
You were shot.

00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:06.833
You were brought to the hospital for emergency treatment.

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:08.399
During the surgery,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.733
your heart stopped for a moment.

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:11.633
Fortunately, the bullet was removed.

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:13.233
Your condition is stable now.

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:14.665
But you need to be hospitalized for observation.

00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:15.666
Do you understand?

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:16.666
Yes.

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:18.133
Get some rest.

00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:19.266
Okay.

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:21.066
- I'll let you talk. - Okay.

00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:29.266
You're awake.

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:32.166
It was really dangerous this time.

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:35.033
You came back from the brink of death.

00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:40.166
How's Yi Wei?

00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:41.766
Don't worry.

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:45.066
I'm afraid he'll be shocked when he hears about this.

00:05:45.233 --> 00:05:46.599
I've already notified the people there...

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600
to keep an eye on him.

00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:49.600
When it's visiting hours,

00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:51.166
I'll go see him.

00:05:52.733 --> 00:05:53.733
Okay.

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:55.766
The police said it was a robbery.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.733
Was it really a robbery?

00:06:03.366 --> 00:06:04.366
Judge Shen.

00:06:04.766 --> 00:06:07.000
I'm here to see how Judge Qin is doing.

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:11.333
Councilor Huang.

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:14.033
Qin Yu is in enough trouble as it is.

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:16.166
He's just an ordinary judge.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400
I hope...

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:19.133
you can stop coming to him for everything.

00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:30.266
Judge Qin.

00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:31.366
You've suffered a lot.

00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:34.166
Thank you for your concern.

00:06:35.466 --> 00:06:36.933
If the public finds out...

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.033
that a judge was attacked,

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:41.266
they'll make all sorts of assumptions.

00:06:41.866 --> 00:06:44.033
They might lose faith in the rule of law.

00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:46.133
So I reminded the media...

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:50.000
to handle the news about your accident quietly.

00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:52.000
We can't allow any negative impact.

00:06:52.033 --> 00:06:53.033
Also,

00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:55.400
as for the thief who robbed you in the parking lot,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.400
I'll urge the police...

00:06:57.666 --> 00:06:58.666
to do their best to arrest him.

00:07:00.033 --> 00:07:01.033
Judge Qin,

00:07:01.233 --> 00:07:02.233
don't worry.

00:07:02.866 --> 00:07:04.433
From this moment on,

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:05.866
I'll ensure the safety...

00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:08.166
of you and your son.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:15.333
All right.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400
Get some rest.

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:17.533
Get well soon.

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:34.232
Intermediate Court Judge Qin Yu...

00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:36.632
was robbed in the courthouse parking lot yesterday.

00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:37.633
He was injured and sent to the hospital.

00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:38.932
According to the hospital,

00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:40.365
Judge Qin Yu was brought to the hospital just in time.

00:07:40.366 --> 00:07:42.165
He is out of danger after emergency treatment.

00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:43.333
His condition is stable for now.

00:07:43.533 --> 00:07:44.733
The police are doing their best to arrest...

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Han Kui Long.

00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:51.733
You're discharged. Pack up and leave.

00:07:53.433 --> 00:07:55.200
Can I leave in this condition?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.632
The doctor said your condition is stable.

00:07:56.633 --> 00:07:57.799
He has signed the discharge notice.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.965
The court has also approved it.

00:07:58.966 --> 00:07:59.966
You have to go back immediately...

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:00.966
and continue serving your sentence.

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:14.133
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:23.566
Wei Wei.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.433
How's Dad?

00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:30.166
Don't worry.

00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:32.400
Your dad is injured,

00:08:32.633 --> 00:08:33.833
but he's much better now.

00:08:34.166 --> 00:08:35.166
Don't worry.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.666
I saw on the news that it was a robbery.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.200
Was it really a robbery?

00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:40.566
There's no other reason.

00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:43.466
Don't make wild guesses.

00:08:43.733 --> 00:08:44.966
Leave it to the police.

00:08:48.266 --> 00:08:49.333
Don't worry.

00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:51.566
Just take care of yourself.

00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:18.433
Grandma, please help me take care of Dad.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.200
I will.

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:27.233
I'm sorry.

00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:30.333
I'm sorry.

00:09:37.633 --> 00:09:38.733
When did you get hurt?

00:09:47.666 --> 00:09:48.666
How did you get hurt?

00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:54.000
Did Dad ask you to do it?

00:09:56.566 --> 00:09:58.065
The one who killed Xiao Gang...

00:09:58.066 --> 00:09:59.233
must die.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.866
I won't accept any reasons.

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:09.533
So you won't listen...

00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:11.266
to my orders anymore?

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400
Don't worry, Mr. Long.

00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:17.633
I know what to do.

00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:21.933
I was the one who wanted to do it.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.333
I know Councilor Huang wants to intervene.

00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:30.266
I'll take responsibility for what I've done.

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:32.766
I'll bear the consequences.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.200
I know.

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:39.000
You've been with my dad for over 20 years.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.000
That's also why...

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:44.233
I've never doubted your loyalty to my dad.

00:10:46.133 --> 00:10:47.266
But the Han family...

00:10:48.533 --> 00:10:49.733
doesn't want foolish loyalty.

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.400
We don't need someone with a one-track mind.

00:10:51.633 --> 00:10:52.633
Before you act,

00:10:52.933 --> 00:10:54.165
you'd better think carefully...

00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:55.933
about what's best for my dad.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.966
Go to a hospital tomorrow for a checkup.

00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:01.966
Then, find a place to hide.

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:03.833
Don't show your face for now.

00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:06.833
But Qin Yu...

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:08.566
Don't cause my dad any more trouble.

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:11.766
I won't say it again.

00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:43.632
We came to the wrong place.

00:11:43.633 --> 00:11:45.333
There's no mistake. This is the place.

00:11:46.233 --> 00:11:47.233
Go.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.200
Get in!

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:05.166
From now on,

00:12:05.533 --> 00:12:06.533
this bed is yours.

00:12:45.533 --> 00:12:46.966
I know you're being paid.

00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:55.433
I'm afraid you won't live...

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.666
to spend the money.

00:13:28.466 --> 00:13:29.466
Mr. Long, have some food.

00:13:43.133 --> 00:13:44.200
So, Mr. Long?

00:13:44.633 --> 00:13:46.766
Is your bed in the shared cell comfortable?

00:13:56.233 --> 00:13:57.233
Are you looking for trouble?

00:13:57.234 --> 00:13:58.565
- What are you doing? - Don't move.

00:13:58.566 --> 00:13:59.965
- Don't move. Back off! - Beat him up!

00:13:59.966 --> 00:14:01.965
Qi Chang Gui, don't make trouble.

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.366
Do you want to be in jail for a few more years?

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.533
That's right.

00:14:08.733 --> 00:14:10.600
I'll be free in two days.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.533
But some people...

00:14:12.933 --> 00:14:14.399
have a long way to go.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.566
How pitiful.

00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:18.166
Let's go back and eat.

00:14:25.166 --> 00:14:26.166
Sit down.

00:14:29.366 --> 00:14:30.366
Eat.

00:14:32.033 --> 00:14:33.033
Han Kui Long.

00:14:33.266 --> 00:14:34.366
Don't cause trouble here.

00:14:37.233 --> 00:14:38.233
Han Kui Long.

00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:39.533
Stand over there.

00:14:41.966 --> 00:14:43.166
Stand over there!

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:00.366
Hold this.

00:15:01.766 --> 00:15:02.933
Take it!

00:15:10.533 --> 00:15:11.533
Squat down.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.966
Squat down!

00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:23.066
Eat.

00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:41.533
I held it in for too long.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.333
That felt good.

00:16:10.433 --> 00:16:11.433
Where's Huang Xiao?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Councilor Huang...

00:16:14.133 --> 00:16:15.566
has a lot of work to handle.

00:16:18.233 --> 00:16:19.233
I'll only talk to him.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.766
Councilor Huang is really busy.

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:25.466
He's busy cleaning up someone's mess.

00:16:26.366 --> 00:16:28.366
So if things haven't been going well for you here,

00:16:28.766 --> 00:16:30.400
I'm sure you can understand, right?

00:16:31.666 --> 00:16:33.066
Actually, if there's anything you want to say,

00:16:33.433 --> 00:16:34.666
I can pass on the message for you.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.966
I want him to come and talk to me himself.

00:16:38.433 --> 00:16:39.766
Councilor Huang said...

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.166
that if there's nothing special,

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.566
we shouldn't disturb you.

00:16:43.066 --> 00:16:44.633
He'll talk to Young Master Lie directly.

00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:46.366
It's the same anyway.

00:16:47.133 --> 00:16:48.832
It's not convenient for him...

00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:50.000
to come to prison all the time.

00:16:50.233 --> 00:16:52.933
I'm the one who calls the shots in the Han family.

00:16:54.266 --> 00:16:55.366
Councilor Huang said...

00:16:56.033 --> 00:16:57.533
that although Young Master Lie is young,

00:16:57.833 --> 00:16:59.933
he already understands to look at the big picture.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.799
He knows what to do...

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.266
to best serve Hokong...

00:17:03.533 --> 00:17:05.133
and your Han family's interests.

00:17:05.766 --> 00:17:06.766
So, Mr. Long,

00:17:06.767 --> 00:17:07.800
you can rest assured...

00:17:08.133 --> 00:17:09.133
and let go.

00:17:09.933 --> 00:17:10.933
Because you...

00:17:10.966 --> 00:17:12.066
have a successor now.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:22.233
Jerk!

00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:28.333
Let me confirm this one more time.

00:17:28.766 --> 00:17:30.199
The robber was wearing a motorcycle helmet,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.466
so you couldn't see his face.

00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:32.833
That's right.

00:17:32.866 --> 00:17:34.366
Are you sure it was a robbery...

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.933
and not something else?

00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:38.600
I'm sure it was a robbery.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.366
Because the robber...

00:17:40.533 --> 00:17:41.533
asked me for money.

00:17:41.933 --> 00:17:44.000
Inspector Tang should've heard it too.

00:17:44.633 --> 00:17:45.633
Judge Qin.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.133
In Madam's statement,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.800
she said she only saw the robber shoot you.

00:17:50.066 --> 00:17:51.066
She didn't hear...

00:17:51.233 --> 00:17:52.366
the robber asking for money.

00:17:53.933 --> 00:17:56.233
You shouldn't be revealing other people's statements.

00:17:57.533 --> 00:17:58.533
No matter what,

00:17:58.833 --> 00:18:00.800
I'm grateful to Inspector Tang for saving me.

00:18:02.566 --> 00:18:03.566
Well?

00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:04.666
It's strange.

00:18:04.766 --> 00:18:06.200
It's like he made a deal with someone...

00:18:06.433 --> 00:18:07.433
to say it was a robbery.

00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:10.333
Let me talk to him.

00:18:17.033 --> 00:18:18.033
Come in.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400
Let me help you.

00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:23.433
Thank you.

00:18:28.966 --> 00:18:30.666
The Han family clearly wants to kill you.

00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:33.233
Why are you still protecting them?

00:18:35.233 --> 00:18:36.333
I've said...

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.000
that it was an attempted robbery in my statement.

00:18:39.366 --> 00:18:40.400
Isn't that clear enough?

00:18:42.366 --> 00:18:44.466
I took you to the hospital that night.

00:18:46.466 --> 00:18:48.400
Do you know how you looked...

00:18:48.633 --> 00:18:49.633
when you were in the ambulance?

00:18:51.333 --> 00:18:53.133
You were so relaxed.

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:56.133
You didn't seem to be resisting death at all.

00:18:56.866 --> 00:18:58.033
I could even say...

00:18:59.166 --> 00:19:00.400
you wanted to accept it.

00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:05.966
I know you can't let go of your son.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.166
That's why you chose to wake up.

00:19:11.433 --> 00:19:12.832
People all have worries...

00:19:12.833 --> 00:19:13.966
and things they can't let go of.

00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:16.633
Don't you?

00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:23.800
No matter what you say,

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.200
I'll investigate this case...

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:29.066
as an attempted murder.

00:19:49.833 --> 00:19:50.833
Delivery.

00:19:52.433 --> 00:19:53.433
Come in.

00:19:56.733 --> 00:19:57.733
Tang Xuan.

00:19:57.766 --> 00:19:59.566
Are you going to keep renting this place?

00:20:01.566 --> 00:20:03.766
He paid a year's rent at once.

00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:05.400
It's a waste not to live here.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.666
I'll think about it when the lease is up.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.565
You want to turn this place...

00:20:16.566 --> 00:20:17.766
into your office?

00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:22.266
Even though the case is closed,

00:20:24.466 --> 00:20:26.166
seeking justice for Officer Shi...

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.833
is the only thing I can do for him.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.032
Aren't you in a hurry to get to work?

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:36.033
Go.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200
It's almost time.

00:20:46.533 --> 00:20:48.166
Whether you go home or not today,

00:20:48.533 --> 00:20:50.000
I'll put the food in the fridge.

00:20:50.233 --> 00:20:52.166
Heat it up if you're hungry.

00:20:56.066 --> 00:20:57.133
Don't worry.

00:20:57.766 --> 00:20:59.333
Your sister can take care of herself.

00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:01.333
Go on. You're going to be late.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.600
Remember to eat.

00:21:03.933 --> 00:21:04.933
Okay.

00:21:50.066 --> 00:21:51.066
Mr. Long.

00:21:51.166 --> 00:21:52.332
You look so pale.

00:21:52.333 --> 00:21:53.333
Did you not sleep well?

00:21:58.066 --> 00:21:59.533
Did you take your medicine on time?

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.365
I've already given them...

00:22:01.366 --> 00:22:02.600
this week's medicine.

00:22:05.333 --> 00:22:06.733
What happened?

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.666
Why did things become like this all of a sudden?

00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:11.466
Wasn't it promised that someone would take care of you?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.065
Tell Xiao Lie...

00:22:13.066 --> 00:22:14.466
to get me out of here as soon as possible.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.466
Otherwise,

00:22:17.766 --> 00:22:19.266
prepare to bury me.

00:22:20.266 --> 00:22:21.666
What happened?

00:22:22.266 --> 00:22:23.966
I've really thought it through.

00:22:25.666 --> 00:22:27.366
I'm getting old.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.033
There's no need for me...

00:22:29.366 --> 00:22:30.466
to endure this anymore.

00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:32.133
Mr. Long.

00:22:32.266 --> 00:22:33.600
Don't think too much.

00:22:33.833 --> 00:22:35.633
I'll ask Xiao Lie to think of a way.

00:22:36.333 --> 00:22:37.566
Hang in there.

00:22:48.733 --> 00:22:49.733
What's up?

00:22:51.766 --> 00:22:53.400
You haven't visited your dad lately.

00:22:55.466 --> 00:22:57.066
There has been a lot to do at the casino.

00:22:58.366 --> 00:22:59.366
Is Dad all right?

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.732
Your dad...

00:23:00.733 --> 00:23:02.433
was transferred from solitary to general population.

00:23:02.633 --> 00:23:03.765
Just like the other inmates,

00:23:03.766 --> 00:23:04.866
he has no privileges anymore.

00:23:05.633 --> 00:23:07.600
He can't sleep or eat well.

00:23:07.966 --> 00:23:09.266
He looks so haggard.

00:23:09.733 --> 00:23:11.866
I don't even know if they'll give him his medicine.

00:23:12.533 --> 00:23:14.266
I've never seen him like this.

00:23:15.333 --> 00:23:16.966
Your dad wants me to tell you this.

00:23:17.266 --> 00:23:18.733
You must help him get out.

00:23:19.266 --> 00:23:20.266
Otherwise,

00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:21.633
he'll die.

00:23:23.066 --> 00:23:24.066
I got it.

00:23:24.666 --> 00:23:25.832
Your father...

00:23:25.833 --> 00:23:27.433
has to take his medication on time.

00:23:27.966 --> 00:23:29.733
- Otherwise, his heart... - I said, I got it.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.400
I'll take care of it.

00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:37.333
Okay.

00:23:41.566 --> 00:23:42.566
Second Master Han.

00:23:43.266 --> 00:23:44.266
Councilor Huang.

00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:45.333
Have a seat.

00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:47.366
You didn't walk into the wrong room.

00:23:47.666 --> 00:23:48.966
I indeed didn't make an appointment with you.

00:23:49.466 --> 00:23:50.533
But as you know,

00:23:51.066 --> 00:23:52.866
you're a busy man.

00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:54.999
I have no choice but to borrow 10 minutes...

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
from the esteemed guest you're meeting.

00:23:57.066 --> 00:23:58.866
A problem that can be resolved in 10 minutes...

00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:00.766
shouldn't be a big problem.

00:24:03.466 --> 00:24:05.133
My dad is not in good health.

00:24:05.966 --> 00:24:07.366
I hope you can...

00:24:08.066 --> 00:24:09.400
take care of him.

00:24:11.566 --> 00:24:12.866
I've been very busy...

00:24:13.166 --> 00:24:15.233
with Judge Qin's robbery.

00:24:15.966 --> 00:24:17.665
Tonight's dinner is also...

00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:19.333
regarding the safety of Hokong.

00:24:20.233 --> 00:24:22.600
If Mr. Long hasn't been getting the best treatment,

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.165
please apologize to him...

00:24:24.166 --> 00:24:25.399
on my behalf.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.400
I'm very sorry.

00:24:27.266 --> 00:24:28.366
But let me put it this way.

00:24:28.566 --> 00:24:30.133
Mr. Long is not young anymore.

00:24:30.466 --> 00:24:32.166
If he doesn't control his temper,

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.766
it's not good for his health.

00:24:37.466 --> 00:24:38.466
You should know...

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.633
it's not hard for an old man like him...

00:24:40.833 --> 00:24:41.833
to control his temper.

00:24:42.766 --> 00:24:44.866
Just let him out on medical parole.

00:24:45.933 --> 00:24:47.600
If he's in my sight,

00:24:48.033 --> 00:24:49.033
he'll be safe,

00:24:49.566 --> 00:24:51.166
and everyone else will be safe too.

00:24:52.366 --> 00:24:53.833
Do you have the final say in the Han family?

00:24:58.233 --> 00:24:59.733
Whether I have the final say or not...

00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:01.800
depends...

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.366
on my dad's safety.

00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:13.066
Medical parole...

00:25:13.633 --> 00:25:14.933
will take some time.

00:25:16.166 --> 00:25:18.000
But this is a win-win situation.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.933
I look forward to it.

00:25:22.266 --> 00:25:24.433
I also want my dad to get his previous privileges back.

00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:26.433
Also,

00:25:27.133 --> 00:25:28.333
I want to see my dad.

00:25:28.833 --> 00:25:29.933
Alone.

00:25:30.866 --> 00:25:32.800
I've been really busy lately.

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:35.833
However,

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.000
my assistant, Mr. Feng, can arrange it.

00:25:43.233 --> 00:25:44.233
Sorry for bothering you.

00:25:58.233 --> 00:25:59.233
Dad.

00:26:02.466 --> 00:26:03.566
Didn't you take your medicine?

00:26:04.233 --> 00:26:05.533
Did they not give you your medicine?

00:26:05.733 --> 00:26:06.733
Here.

00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:08.066
Be careful.

00:26:11.133 --> 00:26:12.733
What's the point of taking medicine?

00:26:14.833 --> 00:26:16.066
I'm old.

00:26:22.033 --> 00:26:23.400
Mr. Qiang got injured too.

00:26:25.133 --> 00:26:26.733
Maybe he's really getting old.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.532
It's best not to let him...

00:26:28.533 --> 00:26:29.800
risk his life anymore.

00:26:32.433 --> 00:26:33.566
Ms. Lin made this soup.

00:26:33.933 --> 00:26:35.033
It's supposed to replenish your vital energy and blood.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400
Drink it while it's hot.

00:26:47.066 --> 00:26:48.066
Dad.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.533
As long as you can be cured,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.733
it doesn't matter how serious it is.

00:26:53.433 --> 00:26:54.800
Just don't die.

00:26:57.266 --> 00:26:58.266
Otherwise,

00:27:00.066 --> 00:27:02.033
how can I apply for you to be released...

00:27:02.633 --> 00:27:04.033
on medical parole?

00:28:46.033 --> 00:28:47.033
Yi Wei.

00:28:47.133 --> 00:28:48.666
Hello, Dad.

00:28:50.866 --> 00:28:51.866
How are you?

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400
I'm fine.

00:28:54.033 --> 00:28:55.400
Did Grandma tell you everything?

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.365
I want to tell you...

00:28:57.366 --> 00:28:58.765
that these few days,

00:28:58.766 --> 00:29:00.066
I won't be able to visit you.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.800
How are you doing?

00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:03.866
Are you okay?

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.800
I'm...

00:29:10.966 --> 00:29:12.066
I'm fine.

00:29:13.533 --> 00:29:14.533
That's good.

00:29:15.266 --> 00:29:17.000
You have to be careful too, okay?

00:29:19.566 --> 00:29:20.566
I'm sorry.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.133
Can I talk to my dad a little longer?

00:29:25.033 --> 00:29:26.033
Wei Wei?

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.133
Time's up. Go back.

00:29:29.366 --> 00:29:30.600
You talk too much.

00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:32.666
Go back to your cell if your call is over.

00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:33.833
Don't dawdle.

00:29:56.666 --> 00:29:57.666
Hi.

00:29:57.666 --> 00:29:58.666
Officer Hu.

00:30:03.933 --> 00:30:04.933
What are you doing?

00:30:05.366 --> 00:30:06.400
Are you still trying to overturn the case?

00:30:09.033 --> 00:30:10.166
Do you have any new leads?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
No.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.633
But I found something strange.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.233
Zhi Yang's killer...

00:30:17.466 --> 00:30:19.166
also confessed to killing Han Gang.

00:30:19.466 --> 00:30:20.833
Why would he do that?

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.865
Isn't he afraid of being killed...

00:30:22.866 --> 00:30:24.433
by Han Kui Long's men in prison?

00:30:24.733 --> 00:30:26.865
Moreover, the judge for this case...

00:30:26.866 --> 00:30:28.066
happened to be Qin Yu,

00:30:28.533 --> 00:30:30.800
and Qin Yu is the one I suspected the most.

00:30:31.066 --> 00:30:32.166
How could there be such a coincidence?

00:30:32.433 --> 00:30:33.433
Everyone...

00:30:33.833 --> 00:30:35.332
seems unrelated on the surface,

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:36.333
but...

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.600
I feel like there's an invisible hand...

00:30:38.833 --> 00:30:40.233
controlling everything behind the scenes.

00:30:41.733 --> 00:30:43.000
There's also Da Gama.

00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:45.432
Without any evidence,

00:30:45.433 --> 00:30:47.599
he just declared Qin Yu's shooting...

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.832
to be a robbery.

00:30:48.833 --> 00:30:49.866
It makes no sense at all.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.733
You don't think it was a robbery?

00:30:53.933 --> 00:30:55.933
If you were a thief with a gun...

00:30:56.033 --> 00:30:57.265
and wanted to commit robbery,

00:30:57.266 --> 00:31:00.099
you could go to mansions or casinos...

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.233
and rob rich people.

00:31:01.666 --> 00:31:03.800
Why rob a judge at the courthouse?

00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:06.533
This is clearly an act of revenge by a gang.

00:31:07.766 --> 00:31:08.766
Okay.

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:10.365
So the Han family...

00:31:10.366 --> 00:31:12.165
wants revenge on Qin Yu...

00:31:12.166 --> 00:31:14.433
because he killed Han Gang.

00:31:14.866 --> 00:31:15.866
What's his motive?

00:31:16.433 --> 00:31:18.566
I don't know his motive yet.

00:31:19.133 --> 00:31:21.400
But I'm sure he's the real murderer.

00:31:23.566 --> 00:31:24.566
By the way,

00:31:24.567 --> 00:31:25.999
regarding the CCTV footage...

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.400
that Guo Hua and the others brought back from the hospital,

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.433
after reviewing the footage,

00:31:29.733 --> 00:31:31.633
they found that in the days before Han Gang's death,

00:31:32.166 --> 00:31:33.166
Qin Yu...

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.466
had indeed been to the hospital.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.100
So,

00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:39.332
your speculation...

00:31:39.333 --> 00:31:40.966
is not entirely baseless.

00:31:42.933 --> 00:31:44.166
What about his alibi?

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.832
He couldn't have killed someone...

00:31:46.833 --> 00:31:47.866
while drinking coffee.

00:31:48.133 --> 00:31:49.865
If he's the real killer,

00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:51.466
his alibi is fake.

00:31:51.933 --> 00:31:52.965
I just haven't found any evidence...

00:31:52.966 --> 00:31:53.966
that proves he did it yet.

00:31:54.433 --> 00:31:55.433
Do you know...

00:31:55.434 --> 00:31:56.599
that what you're thinking right now...

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.766
is very dangerous?

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.833
Then why did you come to me?

00:32:02.433 --> 00:32:04.465
I want you to keep a low profile.

00:32:04.466 --> 00:32:06.833
Don't let Da Gama know that you're investigating.

00:32:07.333 --> 00:32:09.233
This is why I won't reinstate you.

00:32:13.366 --> 00:32:14.366
Officer Hu.

00:32:16.366 --> 00:32:17.366
Thank you.

00:32:19.233 --> 00:32:20.233
I really don't know...

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.800
how to thank you.

00:32:24.966 --> 00:32:26.600
If you take them down for me,

00:32:27.733 --> 00:32:29.166
I'll truly be grateful.

00:32:31.033 --> 00:32:33.033
Whether Da Gama can be brought down...

00:32:33.666 --> 00:32:34.666
depends on you.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.732
Luckily, your necklace took the hit.

00:32:39.733 --> 00:32:41.033
It changed the angle of the bullet.

00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:43.233
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been your lung that got shot,

00:32:43.366 --> 00:32:44.366
but the heart.

00:32:49.566 --> 00:32:50.566
Add two spoons first.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.800
Wei Wei, I'll give you a task.

00:32:53.133 --> 00:32:54.365
Be an old-fashioned whisk.

00:32:54.366 --> 00:32:55.366
- Sift it first. - Hold this here.

00:32:55.833 --> 00:32:56.833
Okay.

00:33:10.533 --> 00:33:11.666
You want me to stay...

00:33:12.333 --> 00:33:14.266
so I can take good care of our son.

00:33:17.333 --> 00:33:18.333
Don't worry.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.866
I won't let you down.

00:33:36.366 --> 00:33:37.366
Young Master Lie.

00:33:37.733 --> 00:33:38.733
Is your injury better?

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.400
It's much better.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.400
Did you visit my dad today?

00:33:49.533 --> 00:33:50.533
Mr. Long...

00:33:50.766 --> 00:33:52.666
gave this to Han Gang before he went to jail.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.033
Now, he wants me to give it to you.

00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:57.033
Mr. Long said...

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.200
that the Han family...

00:33:58.733 --> 00:33:59.733
is counting on you now.

00:34:10.533 --> 00:34:11.633
Tell him not to worry.

00:34:13.066 --> 00:34:14.066
This is the application...

00:34:14.067 --> 00:34:16.800
that I had drafted by an entire team of lawyers.

00:34:17.066 --> 00:34:18.400
I promised I'd get him out.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400
I'm a man of my word.

00:34:21.133 --> 00:34:22.133
That's good.

00:34:31.866 --> 00:34:32.866
Dad.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.066
You still don't understand me.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.733
Chang Rong, I'm back.

00:35:03.033 --> 00:35:04.666
You look sturdy.

00:35:05.633 --> 00:35:06.633
You even got stronger.

00:35:06.634 --> 00:35:08.665
Of course. It's full of men in there.

00:35:08.666 --> 00:35:09.732
If I didn't work out every day,

00:35:09.733 --> 00:35:10.733
how could I expend my energy?

00:35:10.933 --> 00:35:12.200
Speaking of which, let's get a massage.

00:35:12.366 --> 00:35:13.366
I haven't let my energy out in a long time.

00:35:13.466 --> 00:35:15.266
There's plenty of time. What's the rush?

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.799
I've prepared pomelo leaves...

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.833
to get rid of your bad luck.

00:35:19.066 --> 00:35:20.599
I have something serious to discuss with you.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.600
Okay.

00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:23.333
Have some roast pork.

00:35:23.433 --> 00:35:24.632
It was fresh out of the oven this morning.

00:35:24.633 --> 00:35:25.633
It's fresh and hot.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.400
- Let me try. - Mr. Qi, here's your beer.

00:35:31.133 --> 00:35:32.133
It's delicious.

00:35:40.233 --> 00:35:41.266
I haven't drunk for three years.

00:35:41.433 --> 00:35:42.533
This is my first sip of beer.

00:35:42.666 --> 00:35:43.666
It's so good.

00:35:46.066 --> 00:35:47.433
Although there was no alcohol in there,

00:35:48.233 --> 00:35:49.433
before I came out,

00:35:49.666 --> 00:35:51.466
I got to make fun of Han Kui Long in front of everyone.

00:35:51.633 --> 00:35:52.633
It felt so good.

00:35:52.966 --> 00:35:54.400
Petty fights...

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.833
can't kill him.

00:35:57.266 --> 00:35:58.266
Look at the Han family now.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.566
The old one is in jail,

00:35:59.933 --> 00:36:01.066
and the older son is dead.

00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:02.365
There's only the youngest one left.

00:36:02.366 --> 00:36:03.366
What can he do?

00:36:03.466 --> 00:36:05.066
Don't underestimate that kid.

00:36:05.633 --> 00:36:06.666
He's very smart.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.966
I've never been afraid.

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:10.600
Chang Rong, leave him to me.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.965
I'll kill him right away.

00:36:11.966 --> 00:36:13.466
Behave yourself.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.366
I have another task for you.

00:36:17.233 --> 00:36:18.233
What task?

00:36:19.266 --> 00:36:20.433
Starting tomorrow,

00:36:20.633 --> 00:36:22.066
follow Granduncle closely.

00:36:22.466 --> 00:36:23.799
No matter what he does,

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.000
you must tell me immediately.

00:36:26.433 --> 00:36:27.833
Another man?

00:36:28.066 --> 00:36:29.333
And it's even an old granduncle.

00:36:31.866 --> 00:36:33.000
What's your plan this time?

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.266
We can make a lot of money...

00:36:35.633 --> 00:36:37.066
without fights and bloodshed.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.600
Isn't that great?

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:42.865
- Great! - Marvelous!

00:36:42.866 --> 00:36:44.032
Let's cut the roast pig.

00:36:44.033 --> 00:36:45.533
May everything go smoothly from now on.

00:36:45.733 --> 00:36:46.965
- Prosperity for our villagers! - Great!

00:36:46.966 --> 00:36:47.966
- Good! - Awesome!

00:36:48.566 --> 00:36:50.066
All right, everyone, please sit.

00:36:51.766 --> 00:36:52.866
My fellow villagers,

00:36:53.133 --> 00:36:54.966
my brothers and sisters of the Old City District,

00:36:55.266 --> 00:36:57.366
just now, Granduncle performed...

00:36:57.633 --> 00:36:59.632
the divination ritual three times.

00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:01.133
All three tries showed uncertainty.

00:37:01.766 --> 00:37:02.766
Therefore,

00:37:02.767 --> 00:37:03.933
as fate tells us,

00:37:04.066 --> 00:37:06.366
as the District Committee Chairman,

00:37:06.566 --> 00:37:07.999
I announce that we oppose the sale...

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.332
of all land in the Old City District.

00:37:09.333 --> 00:37:11.365
- That's right! - Good!

00:37:11.366 --> 00:37:12.566
To this day,

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.632
our Old City District is the only place in Hokong...

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:17.733
that retains centuries of historical charm.

00:37:18.266 --> 00:37:20.365
We cannot let those unscrupulous real estate developers...

00:37:20.366 --> 00:37:21.366
turn our Old City District...

00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:22.965
into something unrecognizable.

00:37:22.966 --> 00:37:24.065
- Good! - That's right!

00:37:24.066 --> 00:37:26.033
- Good! - Great!

00:37:26.433 --> 00:37:27.866
The land in our Old City District...

00:37:28.033 --> 00:37:29.833
is our root, left by our ancestors.

00:37:30.233 --> 00:37:31.932
We will not yield an inch.

00:37:31.933 --> 00:37:33.666
- Not an inch! - Not an inch!

00:37:33.966 --> 00:37:36.265
If anyone dares to trample on our homeland,

00:37:36.266 --> 00:37:37.966
we must unite...

00:37:38.166 --> 00:37:39.166
and fight to the end!

00:37:39.167 --> 00:37:43.165
- Fight to the end! - Fight to the end!

00:37:43.166 --> 00:37:45.333
All right. I'll add one more thing.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.433
The land deed of the Old City District...

00:37:47.633 --> 00:37:50.433
grants us the right of permanent residence.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.066
So, I've filed a lawsuit...

00:37:53.366 --> 00:37:55.566
to reject the real estate developer's application.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.800
It's fate.

00:37:56.801 --> 00:37:59.232
You can't mess with fate. Isn't that right?

00:37:59.233 --> 00:38:00.332
- Yes, that's right. - Yes!

00:38:00.333 --> 00:38:01.932
- That's right! - Yes!

00:38:01.933 --> 00:38:03.865
Everyone, let's share the roast pork.

00:38:03.866 --> 00:38:05.333
- Come, eat the roast pork. - Great!

00:38:05.966 --> 00:38:06.966
Come on.

00:38:11.133 --> 00:38:12.232
Good, I'll take this piece.

00:38:12.233 --> 00:38:13.400
Yes, we'll take that one.

00:38:19.066 --> 00:38:22.133
So? Didn't I put on a good show?

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:24.866
You rascal, what did you do?

00:38:25.066 --> 00:38:27.133
All three tries of the ritual showed uncertainty.

00:38:30.733 --> 00:38:31.966
The secret cannot be revealed.

00:38:34.633 --> 00:38:35.633
Hey, Chang Rong.

00:38:35.733 --> 00:38:36.832
Now that we're done with business,

00:38:36.833 --> 00:38:38.799
shouldn't we do something fun...

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.800
to reward me?

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Sure.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.000
I'll take you for some excitement.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.400
Surprised, right?

00:38:52.133 --> 00:38:53.466
Neither of us died.

00:38:54.333 --> 00:38:55.933
Do you think I was lucky,

00:38:56.366 --> 00:38:57.766
or were you just unlucky?

00:39:05.233 --> 00:39:06.732
If you really wanted to kill me,

00:39:06.733 --> 00:39:08.199
you wouldn't be saying so much.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.200
Are you trying to scare me?

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.733
You shot me here.

00:39:14.233 --> 00:39:16.000
You really don't believe I'll get back at you?

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.400
The police...

00:39:20.566 --> 00:39:21.966
doesn't believe I was robbed anyway.

00:39:22.433 --> 00:39:23.433
It's good that you're here.

00:39:24.033 --> 00:39:25.033
Look behind you.

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:30.533
Whoever wants to kill me...

00:39:30.866 --> 00:39:31.966
won't be able to get away with it.

00:39:41.833 --> 00:39:42.833
Don't worry.

00:39:43.366 --> 00:39:44.766
Your life is still useful to me.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.066
I'll let you live for now.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.866
Han Lie can't kill you now anyway.

00:39:49.266 --> 00:39:50.565
As for the future, will it be me...

00:39:50.566 --> 00:39:51.966
or Han Lie who sends you off?

00:39:52.833 --> 00:39:53.833
There's no rush.

00:39:54.133 --> 00:39:55.766
We'll take our time.

00:39:57.766 --> 00:39:59.333
Chang Rong, the medical staff are coming.

00:40:01.133 --> 00:40:02.133
Let's go.
