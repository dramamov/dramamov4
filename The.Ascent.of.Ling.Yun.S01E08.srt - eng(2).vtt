(Someone! Chief Wu is Harassing Me)

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.320
Wait.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.640
Eunuch Gao, I've got something to say.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.056
Let go of her.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.600
Eunuch Gao,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.360
I'm a newcomer in Servitude Bureau
and don't know the rules.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.400
Your discipline was justified.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.520
From now on, I will behave properly

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.640
and be at your service.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.480
Who wants your money?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.800
Enough.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.760
You know what's good for you.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.000
All of you, stay put!

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.120
Don't cause any more trouble.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.960
Ever since you left
the Fragrance Bureau,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.680
they've been giving me a hard time.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.880
Later, they found an excuse

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.720
and sent me here.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.400
Ru Yi,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.200
I got you into this.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.480
Ling Yun, don't say that.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.320
Actually, I got you into this.

00:01:49.216 --> 00:01:51.080
You didn't know
that after my mother died,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.720
you were the only one on my side.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.200
If it weren't for you,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.760
I don't know
how I would've made it this far.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.040
I heard

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.960
the masters grant clemency every spring.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.760
Hold on a little longer.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.840
When the time comes,
beg for their mercy.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.480
Maybe you can leave
the Servitude Bureau.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.240
With some luck,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.600
you might even escape
the imperial harem earlier.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.040
We're just lowly servants
from the Servitude Bureau.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.920
Which master would care about us?

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.440
Even if there's clemency,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.640
no one would remember us.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.280
But with you by my side,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.720
I'm not afraid anymore.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.904
Don't worry.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.520
I'll protect you.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.600
From now on,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.880
I'll protect you properly.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.520
I won't let them bully you again.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.960
Those who dare bully us

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.760
won't get away with it.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.280
Listen well.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.440
I'll throw her into the well soon.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.480
If she struggles,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.600
hold her down for me.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.128
Eunuch Gao,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.600
I'll help you kill Ling Yun.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.560
You must keep your word,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.720
plead with Consort Wan for me

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.080
and get me out of the Servitude Bureau.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.640
Well, rest assured.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.760
You'll get your reward after it's done.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.800
Thank you, Eunuch Gao.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.080
What are you doing?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.920
Help!

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.000
Let go!

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.976
Let go!

00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:45.920
Help me!

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.080
- Help!
- Hurry!

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.480
Do you want to leave
the Servitude Bureau or not?

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.520
Help!

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.480
Let go!

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.184
Harder!

00:03:58.688 --> 00:03:59.680
Help!

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.544
Hurry!

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.928
Let go!

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.520
Harder! How could you...

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.064
Chief Wu,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.160
why have you come
to the Servitude Bureau?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.240
You insolent servants!

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.920
How dare you attempt murder
in the palace!

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.800
Drag them out and beat them to death!

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.280
- Chief Wu, spare me!
- Chief Wu,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.680
spare me!

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.840
Eunuch Gao threatened me.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.320
If I didn't obey,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.080
he would throw me into the well.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.440
It's Consort Wan.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.560
Her servant Madam Jiang

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.160
ordered Eunuch Gao to kill Ling Yun.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.560
I had nothing to do with it.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.160
I was forced into this.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.080
My lord.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.840
Take them away.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.840
Thirty lashes.

00:04:50.228 --> 00:04:52.467
Chief Wu. Please have mercy.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.800
Thank you for saving me.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.200
If you hadn't arrived in time,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.840
I'd be dead in that well now.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.720
Since you've already faced death,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.840
learn from this experience.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.464
My lord,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.360
you're the only one here
who can oppose Consort Wan.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.000
You and the Fourteen Bureaus
are my only hope.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.040
It's a pity
that you dismissed me before.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.600
Why is Consort Wan determined
to kill you?

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.280
Because

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.040
I discovered one of her secrets.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.760
But even if I didn't know these things,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.240
if she knew who I am,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.080
she would still do everything
to eliminate me.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.360
Who are you?

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.480
My Lord,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.440
you didn't choose me that night.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.320
Would you reconsider tonight?

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.080
Choosing a nearly crippled person
like you?

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.480
My Lord,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.760
please grant me some wound medicine.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.920
If this wound festers,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.360
my hands will truly become useless.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.520
Would you let that happen?

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.280
Stay squatting!

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.600
If I can't discipline her,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.080
I can certainly discipline you.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.160
If that bell makes any noise,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.320
you'll be in trouble.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.496
Are you alright?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.040
Chief Wu's pouch is missing.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.600
He asked me to search here.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.320
You're always the greediest one.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.280
You must have stolen it.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.200
Did you see me steal it?

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.240
Why falsely accuse me?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.200
That's an imperial gift.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.280
If an imperial gift is missing here,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.440
everyone will be punished.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.920
Even if you didn't steal it,
you're still guilty.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.624
Really?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.280
A pouch gifted by His Majesty?

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.720
What are you doing?

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840
I didn't steal it!

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.104
Here it is.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.840
The pouch is here.
The evidence is solid.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.000
You still deny stealing it?

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.000
I didn't steal it!

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.960
I swear I didn't!

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.360
With both witnesses and evidence,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.480
how can you still argue?

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.560
Chief Wu spared you during the day,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.360
yet you repay kindness with betrayal.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.040
You're done for this time.

00:08:21.184 --> 00:08:22.120
Ling Yun,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.440
I admit defeat.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.560
I surrender.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.280
Please spare me just once.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.960
I wronged you before.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.920
It was my fault.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.360
I'll never dare to do so again.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.560
Please spare me.

00:08:34.784 --> 00:08:35.720
Cui Wei,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.000
we all came from similar backgrounds.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.560
We entered the palace

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.040
as servants just to survive.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.400
Don't tear others' umbrellas

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.000
just because you got wet.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.080
That's not how the world works.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.360
This will be my last warning.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.240
From now on,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.560
if you bully Ru Yi again,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.680
I'll tell Chief Wu
that you stole his pouch,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.560
ensuring your death.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.480
I wouldn't dare.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.600
I'll never dare again.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.440
I'll never harm Ru Yi again.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.304
Your Highness,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.680
the one from Chengxi Palace
has been quiet lately.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.560
At the Spring Banquet,

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.480
Consort Wan's scheme backfired,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.040
nearly burning herself.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.080
Naturally, she's lying low recently.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.040
Your Highness, you mean

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.760
the blade in the dance shoes
was Consort Wan's doing?

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.040
It was that maid named Ling Yun?

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.920
Not her, either.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.360
The blade was Concubine Zhao's doing,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.960
yet also Consort Wan's.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.920
Well, I don't understand.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.160
Consort Wan planned meticulously.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.600
She knew Concubine Zhao too well.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.280
She knew Concubine Zhao would go
as far as to wound herself to win favor.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.560
So she used the dance shoe plot,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.480
to achieve two goals,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.280
crippling Concubine Zhao's foot

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.560
and framing the maid.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.840
The Zhao sisters only seek favor,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.840
foolishly thinking
His Majesty is stupid.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.120
His Majesty just wanted
to preserve harmony.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.200
Speaking of which,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.320
Consort Wan's maid is impressive.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.080
She discerned His Majesty's intent,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.240
resolved the crisis with a few words,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.280
and saved herself.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.960
Truly clever.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.680
But she's in the Servitude Bureau now.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.800
I guess she's got no hope.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.880
For some people,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.840
the tougher the challenge,
the stronger their spirit becomes.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.960
A mere Servitude Bureau
could never contain her.

00:10:57.428 --> 00:10:58.560
(Fourteen Bureaus)

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.480
Master, here's the wound medicine
you requested.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.600
Only through enduring hardships

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.160
will she learn to restrain herself.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.920
Greetings, Chief Wu.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.360
Mend these clothes,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.960
and I'll give you wound medicine.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.800
You give me wound medicine,

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.480
and I mend your clothes.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.240
It is fair enough.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.040
There's an embroidery workshop.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.640
Why not take it there instead, my lord?

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.920
Their skills far surpass mine.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.592
Done.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.336
Here you are.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.560
Only one bottle?

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.480
It's barely enough for one person.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.720
Ru Yi is also injured.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.520
Look how well I mended this, my lord.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.440
Shouldn't this be worth two bottles?

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.480
Demanding more for yourself
is understandable,

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.440
but pushing your luck for others

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.840
is utter foolishness.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.760
True affection is rare in the palace.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.680
Focus on your own survival.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.608
My lord,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.280
could you get Ru Yi out
of the Servitude Bureau?

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.560
If you can't,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.640
I'll have to parade your pouch around,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.080
telling everyone
we've traded secret gifts

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.400
and formed factions.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.040
Let's see how you explain that then.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.328
You rogue!

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.480
Why do you think I will agree to this?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.080
A mere pouch is enough to threaten me?

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.000
If you don't agree,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.680
I'll have to ruin your reputation.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.080
I have no reputation to protect.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.600
Someone!

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.360
Chief Wu is harassing me!
