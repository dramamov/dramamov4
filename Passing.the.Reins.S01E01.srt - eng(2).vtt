00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.377
To be honest,

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:14.848
I'm baffled by how much you've lost
your will to work over the past year.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:16.783
I don't even know why.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.951
I'm sorry, sir.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.820
Still, you're talented, Kurisu.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.790
You could still work
as a tax accountant anywhere,

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.961
but being cut by a large firm like us
will leave a mark on you forever.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.270
Get your head in the game.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:38.905
Yes, sir.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:42.008
L&U ACCOUNTING FIRM

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.145
Our Kurisu is known
for his meticulous, error-free work.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.014
I believe he's the ideal candidate
for this assignment.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.051
-Mr. Kurisu.
-Yes, sir.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:55.488
I'm not one for beating around the bush,
so I'll get straight to the point.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.626
My company is financially
in dire straits right now.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.261
That can't be!

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.263
When you think of Royal Human,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.300
you think of how Mr. Kozo Sanno made
it an industry leader in one generation.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.804
It's no exaggeration to call it
a true veteran in the temp industry.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.040
We're under the impression
that you're a blue-chip company.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:17.177
Our president exceedingly favors
long-time partners,

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.680
so we have fallen behind
our competitors in securing IT talent.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:25.151
As a result, we've been struggling
terribly these past few years

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:28.555
to the point
where staff layoffs are on the table.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:32.625
Thus, we're considering eliminating
a certain department.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.427
And that is…

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:36.663
HORSE RACING DIVISION

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.131
…our Horse Racing Division.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.167
It was originally set up
to promote our core business,

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:44.904
but since its founding, it's been
in the red for seven straight years.

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.842
I may be airing my family's dirty linen,

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:55.715
but I believe my father is using it
to embezzle funds for personal gain.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.385
I'd like you to investigate
the Horse Racing Division

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:03.323
and see where the money is really going
without my father knowing.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.226
That's why I came to see you.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.228
A hundred million?

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.829
I hear he owns ten horses.

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:12.332
Just keeping them
costs him 100 million yen a year.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.333
Hello!

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:17.170
Unfortunately for him,
they've rarely won him any major races.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:21.174
Without wins you don't get
any prize money, meaning no income.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:25.645
Yet the department sticks around
and keeps buying horses every year.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.749
It's the kind of black box common
in one-man-run, unlisted companies.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.084
It has to be shut down.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.722
Rather, Yutaro's real goal here
is to seize this opportunity

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.857
to force a change in leadership.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:43.163
But they're father and son, right?

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.932
Every family is different.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.168
Thanks.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:52.639
The new president would terminate
their current tax accountant.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.541
And who would take over?

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.109
You.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.178
Now's your chance to redeem yourself!

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:23.536

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.352
Hey, will you be coming home?

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.496
I made it!

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.002
Mr. Kurisu!

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.670
I'm Kaneshiro.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.139
Took you long enough.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.641
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:02.976
HOKURYO FARM
AUCTION SITE THIS WAY

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:04.777
You must have had quite a journey.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.412
There's a direct bus, though.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.781
I couldn't think that far ahead.

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:11.317
Is this whole area, Hokuryo Farm?

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:14.454
Yes, today, we're trading racehorses here.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.623
Listing number 108.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.793
Amy's Champ, a 2010 bay filly.
Foaled on March 18th.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.528
Sired by Bolero.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.364
Starting at 40 million yen.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.232
-40 million?
-Yes!

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:27.867
We've got our first bid.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.703
-41 million?
-Yes!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.705
-45 million!
-45!

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:36.376
-46 million?
-Yes!

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.144
-48 million!
-48!

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.847
-49 million?
-There, 49!

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:43.316
49 million, going into 50.

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:46.619
-50 million?
-Yes!

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:48.187
-There!
-Going into 52 million.

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:49.789
-52 million?
-Isn't it fun?

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:50.957
-Yes!
-54 million.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.825
The owners remain silent,

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:56.863
but the spotters never miss
even the slightest hint.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.699
The price just keeps increasing.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.501
62 million?

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:02.835
Yes, 62!

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:04.337
64 million?

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:05.805
-Yes!
-64 million…

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:08.341
90 million. Going from 90 million.

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:09.542
90 million?

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:10.910
-Yes!
-90 million!

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.578
92 million?

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.314
-Yes!
-92 million.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.349
94 million?

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.650
-Yes!
-94!

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:21.554
-Lock it down!
-96 million?

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:23.356
-Yes!
-96 million!

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:25.358
98 million?

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.393
-Yes!
-98!

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.462
How about 100 million?

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.030
-100?
-Yes, 100!

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:32.965
We've got, 100 million!

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:36.169
Any more? Do I hear 110 million?

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:39.539
110 million?

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:41.274
-Yes!
-110!

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.511
120 million?

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:47.213
-Yes!
-120!

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.649
130 million?

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:51.351
-Yes!
-130!

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.653
140 million?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.787
-Yes!
-140!

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.723
150 million?

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.126
A "horse owner,"
is someone who owns racehorses.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.128
To become one,

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:06.232
one must earn over 20 million yen
a year for two years in a row

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:09.736
and continuously hold assets
worth at least 100 million yen

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:12.739
as per today's
stringent financial requirements.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:18.044
Furthermore, there are over
11,000 racehorses competing annually,

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.981
with each horse earning a yearly average
of about eight million yen.

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:26.152
However, the annual
maintenance cost per racehorse

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.321
is about 8.5 million yen.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:31.524
In reality,
racing alone does not generate profit.

00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:36.462
Even so, many owners are still prepared
to take their steeds to the track.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.771
He said we would go to Hokkaido together.

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:46.105
It's hot.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.373

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.213
Welcome home, Miss.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.350
-Mr. Yamada!
-Yes?

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.085
Welcome home, Miss.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:00.553
-Hey.
-Yes?

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.722
Is it true Dad went to Hokkaido again?

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.358
-He didn't mean to keep it from you.
-Gosh!

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.759
Mom!

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.495
-Mom?
-Yes?

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:13.132
Hey! Dad never seems to learn.

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:17.036
That's what you get from a talentless man.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.539
ROYAL HUMAN F&B DIVISION
KOZO'S WIFE

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:22.408
Thank you, Number 51.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:24.076
Thank you.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.581
Thanks for giving me the chance to bond
with the wonderful Amy's Champ.

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.217
I'm relieved you bought her, Mr. Shiina.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.586
Isn't that a good deal, sir?

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:35.955
Please don't call me "Sir."

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:36.756
STABLE TRAINER

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:38.724
As long as she wins.

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:43.296
Mr. Shiina's killing it.
He earned 900 million just today.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.898
Oh, thank you for having me.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:50.002
I'm here on behalf of L&U Accounting Firm,
I'm Eiji Kurisu.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:50.970
You're late.

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:52.505
What?

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.774
I told you to come before the auction.

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:56.843
You're too late.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:57.977
I'm terribly sorry!

00:07:58.044 --> 00:07:59.278
The bus intervals were…

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.114
Excuse me.

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:09.188
You came in five minutes late,
so I lost five minutes too.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:12.024
With Kaneshiro, that makes ten.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:14.293
If you're an hour late, we'll lose two.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.728
Three hours…

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:18.331
Well, you'll lose six.

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:19.465
That's right!

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:22.301
How much do you think
I can make at that rate?

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:23.669
Time is money.

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.305
Time is bought with money.

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:28.741
You should've come by taxi.

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.843
Yes, I'm terribly sorry about that.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:37.483
-Thank you very much.
-She has a calm temperament.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.417
I see.

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:43.589
So?

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:46.859
What's Yutaro's newly-hired
tax accountant doing here?

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:48.361
What?

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:50.463
Right.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.232
I'd like to confirm a few things

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.801
about your company's
horse racing business.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:59.705
This is what we call a "second opinion."

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:01.908
I'll conduct a thorough,
third-party review

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.609
to see how to further benefit…

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:05.244
Where are you going?

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.548
The Royal "Grill Master."

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:16.055
Oh, hey, this one's ready.

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:19.158
-Thanks, but I'm…
-It's 100 times better than in Tokyo.

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:22.028
You came all the way here
with just one bag

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.663
to restructure my company, right?

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:26.299
Yes, you can't leave empty-handed.

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:27.967
Excuse me. Can I get an extra serving?

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:30.102
-One extra serving, coming up.
-Thanks.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:34.440
So annoying! They should
just bring out five servings.

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:37.577
Excuse me! Want to switch
to a shochu highball?

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:40.746
Yes, make it stronger than usual.

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:41.681
Got it!

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.182
Is beer alright, Mr. Kurisu?

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.918
-No, wait, I…
-Excuse me!

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:48.054
You must be one of those.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.690
Being assigned to us means
you're on the fast track.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:52.725
No, not exactly.

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:55.861
Just say yes to that!

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:58.598
That's like saying our company
doesn't have that kind of value.

00:09:58.664 --> 00:09:59.966
I'm sorry.

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:06.906
So…

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.076
what did Yutaro tell you?

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:15.348
I'm not at liberty to say.

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:19.986
Horse racing.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:21.487
Yes?

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:23.889
Do you watch it?

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:25.491
Not at all.

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:27.827
Well…

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:30.830
Only once when I was a student.

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:33.199
On your own?

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:34.800
No.

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:38.504
-Sorry, my memory fails me.
-Thank you for waiting.

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:40.506
Here you go, five servings!

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.577
Wait. You haven't finished yours?

00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:48.214
All right, cook it nicely.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.416
-Here's a fresh piece.
-No, please…

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:54.520
It's… It's too much.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:57.456
I told you, I'm on a trip for work.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.759
It's a struggle.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:04.196
It's the first anniversary, though.
You should at least show your face.

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:06.699
Sorry. You take care of it.

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:09.735
-I'm hanging up.
-Wait, Eiji--

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:17.643
You only need to flip them once,
but sometimes on reflex, I do it twice!

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.211
Sorry about that.

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:25.384
Are you perhaps a lightweight?

00:11:26.318 --> 00:11:27.253
I have a low tolerance.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.255
I'm sorry.

00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:31.891
Yet, you're still here with us.

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:36.662
My employees have no problem
telling me they can't drink.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.464
You've got guts.

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:41.300
-I feel honored.
-I've grilled more.

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:44.136
Here, eat more please.

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:51.744
Hey. Did you do the night feeding?

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.479
Not yet. Could you?

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.181
I'm going too!

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:56.982
290 million?!

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.317
Is it Hokuryo?

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.052
NOZAKI FARM

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:02.288
I was curious what they sold for today.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:04.924
Don't mind them too much.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.158
Go to bed early.

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:07.960
Okay.

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:11.697
-Don't get too messy.
-Okay!

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:16.836
NOZAKI FARM

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.537
"Don't mind them too much."

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:22.208
TOP-SELLING HORSE AT AUCTION

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:30.449
Switching on.

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:34.887
Okay, now this…

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:35.921
KANAKO'S SON

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:39.091
NOZAKI FARM, RANCH OWNER

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:55.307
Are you all right?

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.543
Yes, I am.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.712
Wait. Where is the auction site?

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.748
Oh, we're not going
to an auction this time.

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:04.550
Hang in there a bit longer.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.252
Hokkaido's Hidaka region

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:09.021
has long flourished
as a thoroughbred breeding ground,

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.557
dotted with numerous ranches.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.893
Horse owners visit each ranch…

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:14.794
HAYASHIDA RANCH

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.798
…to purchase new horses
and decide which races to enter them in.

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:19.765
How are they?

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:21.000
Nothing to report.

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:23.068
Their trainer, Tadokoro, just arrived.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.670
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:26.138
Hello, sir.

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:29.041
-Tadokoro.
-Yes?

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:33.045
Thanks to your lax strategy,
they've only done three races this season!

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:34.280
Mr. Kurisu?

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:36.048
I want to see Fight deliver results!

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:39.018
It's too late to change course now.

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:42.755
Stop your rambling
and give this guy a taste of victory!

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.424
It's in three weeks.
We're behind everyone!

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:47.026
Why not give it a shot?

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:50.029
We made the decision together, didn't we?

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:53.165
-We all have our own schedules…
-I know that.

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:58.771
Is this helpful to you?

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.706
For your second opinion.

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.107
Oh, yes.

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:03.976
It must be hard,

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:07.112
going to each place
to check them firsthand.

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:10.516
The president is especially
passionate about this.

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:13.485
Some people find it hard, but…

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:16.989
this is quite a rare opportunity.

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:25.931
Sir!

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.735
Wow! Izana's gotten more beautiful!

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:31.203
She was always beautiful?

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.241
The president owns that one too?

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:36.175
Yes.

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:38.377
A bit of a special horse.

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:40.713
-The president's here…
-Can you tell?

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.916
She has a crooked leg.

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:44.850
Indeed.

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:47.219
That kind of horse usually doesn't sell.

00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:50.723
With a leg like that,
there's no guarantee they can run.

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:57.263
The president forcibly bought her,
along with Royal Fight from this ranch.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.032
-Mr. Accountant!
-Yes?

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:01.033
Give her a touch.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.568
What? But I…

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:04.370
It's okay. Go on!

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:11.343
Is a horse's value measured
by money or achievements?

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:14.046
To me, it's more than that.

00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:18.517
The value of a horse
can't be measured with mere numbers.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.354
Go on!

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.371
Don't worry, Izana.

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:41.106
Good for you, Izana.

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:46.845
This man is your friend, too.

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:14.440
All right.

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:19.445
Welcome.

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:21.547
Hello, Eiji.

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:23.615
Please come home.

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:27.953
You don't need to help out,
just come pay your respects.

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:39.865
No way.

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:43.102
Eiji?

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.006
Eiji Kurisu?

00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:50.976
Am I wrong?

00:16:52.077 --> 00:16:53.145
Kanako.

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:55.247
Yes!

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:58.984
I thought I'd gotten it wrong
because you didn't respond.

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:01.553
My place is 30 minutes from here.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.957
Oh, I see.

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.259
How long has it been?

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:08.627
I don't know.

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:09.995
Ten years?

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.264
Ten years, huh?

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:13.866
Already?

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:19.204
-Long time no see.
-It really is.

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:21.340
What a coincidence.

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:24.476
Oh, no. You're still using that.

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:26.512
This one's from Hidaka.

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:27.413
No way!

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.115
-Ta-da.
-Oh, me too.

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:34.153
So? What are you doing here?

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:37.890
Sorry!

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:39.925
I need to make dinner.

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:41.193
I see.

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:43.996
-Your kid?
-Yes. Shohei.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.330
Wow.

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:47.699
Oh, then…

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.403
What should I call you now? Your surname.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.571
Right.

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:57.042
I got divorced,
so I'm going by Nozaki again.

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:58.944
I see.

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.212
Coming!

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:04.550
Bye.

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:07.853
Here you go!

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.887
Thanks.

00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:12.357
Those were the last ones, we got lucky.

00:18:14.893 --> 00:18:16.495
Okay, let's go!

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:26.605
-Why're they out of fried chicken?
-It's really too bad.

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:28.073
Hey.

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:30.576
-Hey!
-Excuse me.

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:47.759
I believe my father is using it
to embezzle funds for personal gain.

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:50.996
PALUT HOLDINGS - 467,000 CASH

00:19:00.906 --> 00:19:04.009
Let's now discuss the losses
incurred by Horse Racing.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.345
My investigation confirms

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:09.815
that all items of expenditure
in racehorse maintenance

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:14.319
are significantly higher
than those of the average horse owner.

00:19:14.386 --> 00:19:18.023
Furthermore, opaque expenditures
have been observed in areas

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.359
such as entertainment and transportation.

00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:22.461
While the horse racing business

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:25.464
is ostensibly intended
to boost the company's profile,

00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:27.499
many aspects lack specificity,

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:30.602
making the cost-effectiveness
difficult to assess.

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.171
Thank you.

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:34.907
-Over to the board now.
-Unknown figures, huh?

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:38.143
Well, that's how it is.

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:39.778
What?

00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:41.647
We believe

00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:46.385
we should expedite our withdrawal
from Horse Racing as soon as possible.

00:19:46.451 --> 00:19:48.020
Based on mere numbers?

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:50.923
Do you have any idea
how hard my horses have fought?

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:53.325
To what extent
they have carried the Royal name?

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:56.895
The value you get from that
cannot be represented by mere numbers.

00:19:56.962 --> 00:19:58.063
Sir.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.966
They may have value,
but they're not profitable.

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.768
That's your limitation.

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:05.771
Start again from the entrance exam.

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:10.108
Do you have a dream?

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:13.545
Do you have a dream?

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:15.747
What?

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:18.717
Numbers.

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:21.453
You're merely staring right ahead.

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:24.356
Don't you think you're missing
the bigger picture?

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.124
Let me ask you.

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:29.728
What lies ahead if you take away
a horse's ability to run?

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.831
Do you know, sir?

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:36.134
What lies ahead…

00:20:36.768 --> 00:20:39.605
Are you mistaking horses
for cars or something?

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:42.608
-They're not vehicles.
-Sir.

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:44.643
-They're not toys!
-Sir!

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:48.680
I'd like to discuss the relinquishing
of your horses after this.

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:52.784
I'm so sorry
for how my father treated you.

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.553
Let's hope everything goes well.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.522
We'd greatly appreciate
Mr. Kurisu's continued support.

00:20:57.589 --> 00:21:00.192
Of course! It would be an honor.

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.960
Thank you for your work.

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:02.961
Thank you!

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.266
Yes! You've got this!

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:09.201
That's my man!

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:18.944
Sorry for calling you about this.

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.112
It's okay.

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:22.681
Relinquishing horses?

00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:25.384
Usually, they're handed over
to another owner.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.020
-Yes.
-But in Royal's case…

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:32.090
They have poor results.

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:33.258
Yes.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:38.163
Everyone's playing to win, after all.

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:42.801
If no owner can be found to take them in,

00:21:42.868 --> 00:21:45.003
they can go to racing schools,
riding clubs,

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.706
or even petting zoos instead.

00:21:47.773 --> 00:21:49.441
-I see.
-But…

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:51.576
None of them may have room to spare.

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:54.313
If all of that fails…

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:57.916
Then?

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:06.625
They'll likely be put down.

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:13.131
Put down?

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:18.337
This is a racehorse training facility.

00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:22.474
This is where horses undergo training
in preparation for their races.

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:25.143
Sorry for the trouble.

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:27.846
What's up?

00:22:30.248 --> 00:22:32.084
May I see them?

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:35.987
Royal Fight and Royal Izana.

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:37.923
Where are they now?

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:40.192
What for?

00:22:42.928 --> 00:22:44.062
I'm curious.

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:48.867
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way to Miho,

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:51.703
but you shouldn't get too fond of them.

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:53.805
Or you won't let go.

00:22:57.943 --> 00:23:01.279
Actually, the president came by earlier.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.014
What?

00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:06.585
I thought he came to tell me
about quitting horse racing.

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:10.989
Instead, he left them to me
to make winners out of them.

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:13.759
What should I do?

00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:15.660
-Hey!
-Yes?

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:17.229
Look what we got.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.132
Have you seen Kurisu?

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:21.767
No?

00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:22.934
He's in Hokkaido.

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:24.569
Hokkaido?

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.417
I'm amazed you'd come
all the way to Hidaka.

00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:40.552
It's also my fault.

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:45.157
Is this about the withdrawal?

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:47.025
I'm very sorry.

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:48.727
Want to see them?

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:51.897
Fight has gone back
to the training center,

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:55.500
but Izana is still with me.

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:05.210
Izana!

00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:14.953
The President met her in the fall,
three years ago.

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.255
How did the sire do?

00:24:17.322 --> 00:24:19.458
He's won four major races.

00:24:19.524 --> 00:24:21.593
-Not bad.
-Yes.

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:24.663
Hey. Is that a new horse?

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:27.332
-Yes.
-Is it sold?

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:29.334
No, not yet.

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:31.403
It's…

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.671
It's…

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:35.540
What?

00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:38.643
That was Izana.

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:44.049
She was far weaker than she is now,
with a distinctive gait.

00:24:44.115 --> 00:24:49.287
She was an awkward-looking horse
that clearly no one wanted to touch.

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:55.327
I think she'll grow to be
as dapple-grey as her mother.

00:24:55.393 --> 00:24:56.728
But as you can see,

00:24:57.362 --> 00:25:00.699
there's no telling how well she can run.

00:25:01.933 --> 00:25:05.637
So you'll care for her here till the end?

00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:12.944
Is it a she?

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:15.213
Yes.

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:18.383
What's the dam's name?

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:21.920
It's Izana.

00:25:22.754 --> 00:25:23.889
What does it mean?

00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:26.791
A place in Spain.

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:31.796
My son, who died nine years ago,
named her.

00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:34.933
It's not exactly auspicious, but…

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:42.874
I think that's most likely
Izana's very final foal.

00:25:52.651 --> 00:25:54.586
"Royal Izana."

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:57.756
Exactly nine characters. Not bad.

00:25:57.822 --> 00:25:59.257
Mr. President.

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:02.561
Her and that colt for 30 million.

00:26:02.627 --> 00:26:05.230
If you agree to that price,
I'll take them right away.

00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:09.467
But they aren't worth that high a price…

00:26:10.435 --> 00:26:12.637
I'm the one who decides.

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:16.041
I'm not doing this out of goodwill.

00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:19.744
I'll train her to run
as often as possible.

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:23.682
No matter how little I can get out of her,

00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:29.220
I'll take responsibility
and find a good stud for her.

00:26:30.055 --> 00:26:31.756
Izana's lineage…

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:36.728
is the work your son started,
which I'll preserve.

00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:43.535
I'm counting on you two!

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:46.204
That's how he is.

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.977
I owe him a debt of gratitude.

00:26:56.648 --> 00:26:57.882
Good work, ma'am.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.418
Good work, ma'am.

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:08.159
I left the horse relinquishment
entirely to the broker,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.730
so I expect everything to be settled
within the next month.

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:13.131
I see.

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:16.301
-I'll be going. Take care.
-Yes. Thank you.

00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:20.071
It's smooth sailing here too.

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:22.140
Thanks to you.

00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:24.542
Be it a dream or a fantasy,

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:28.079
gambling is downright stupid,
if I'm being honest.

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.081
He ought to make money the right way.

00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:31.883
Just like you, Mom.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.952
Is he competent?

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:34.953
What?

00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.422
Our current tax accountant.

00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:39.124
Right.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.191
Well…

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.694
He's nothing out of the ordinary.

00:27:43.228 --> 00:27:44.329
Hey!

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:49.300
Sorry for coming this late.

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:51.936
It's okay. We're in the same industry.

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:54.039
How did it go?

00:27:55.674 --> 00:27:56.941
Let me help out.

00:27:57.575 --> 00:27:59.978
Okay, right over there.

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:02.013
Put on the boots.

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:10.055
It's hard to carry on for ranchers
and horse owners in the long term.

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:14.993
The family farm would have gone under
if I hadn't moved back.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.730
I just knew I couldn't let that happen.

00:28:19.597 --> 00:28:21.232
I had to keep it going.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.867
Why?

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:25.370
Did I ever tell you?

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:29.507
A thoroughbred's sire line
can be traced back to only three horses.

00:28:29.574 --> 00:28:30.508
Really?

00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:33.078
Yes, in the beginning, there were three.

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:35.280
Only three in the world.

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:41.186
And to make them stronger and faster,
and push their abilities to the limit,

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:43.922
humans have bred them
through generations of crossbreeding

00:28:43.988 --> 00:28:45.590
to create today's racehorses.

00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:49.327
Of course, some don't pass muster.

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:54.699
But among them, an amazing
blossom will come out of nowhere.

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:56.434
-Put it in here.
-Okay.

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:58.603
A truly incredible horse.

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.974
A horse for a new era,
one that will redefine evolution itself.

00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:09.848
Having reached that point,
at last that horse,

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:14.552
it's ancestors, the humans who raised it,

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:16.988
will all be rewarded.

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:21.192
Only then does value emerge
from what has been built up over time.

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:25.563
I just couldn't bring myself to stop it.

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:33.071
The value you get from that
cannot be represented by mere numbers.

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:39.844
Eiji.

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:43.381
A tax accountant's job
isn't just about crunching numbers.

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:46.718
Go out there
and learn all kinds of things.

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:50.321
Study the world, study the people,

00:29:50.822 --> 00:29:54.058
and someday do work
that will earn gratitude.

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:14.045
If all of that fails,
they'll likely be put down.

00:30:57.822 --> 00:30:58.923
Izana…

00:31:10.802 --> 00:31:12.003
Yes?

00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:15.139
Mr. Kurisu is here, sir.

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:16.908
Excuse me.

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:24.282
I was about to make my case
to push back against you.

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.484
But look at this mess.

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:32.090
So? What brings you here?

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:35.526
I'm seeking a new place for your horses.

00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:42.533
I cannot do anything
about the future of your company.

00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:46.638
As for the fate
of the horses you currently have,

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:49.574
please allow me to assist you.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:53.678
I'm sorry.

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:58.583
Even I don't know
what I'm getting myself into, but…

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:01.653
Please allow me.

00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:03.521
Do you know what
makes a horse good or bad?

00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:09.861
I don't.

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:12.230
For instance,

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:16.067
suppose there are two horses
with all their info hidden.

00:32:16.668 --> 00:32:19.270
One costs 200 million yen.
The other, two million.

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:23.141
I'm not confident I could pick out
the 200 million-yen one.

00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:26.644
Besides, it's not like
I have to choose such a horse.

00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:29.881
One that will fetch me 200 million…

00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:32.050
How the hell should I know?

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:36.521
So if I see that
the person behind the horse

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:40.024
is someone I can trust

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:43.661
and they come to me with real conviction,
I'll invest in it.

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:45.863
I bet on trusting people.

00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:48.766
Can you do that?

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:54.439
No.

00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:58.776
Then stay out of this.

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:01.379
Rather…

00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:05.216
you can bet on me.

00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:12.824
Please provide me with all the ledgers,
contracts, receipts,

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.660
and other records here
pertaining to Horse Racing.

00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:18.563
I'll peruse every document,

00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:23.034
payee, supplier,
associate, and business partner.

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:29.874
I'll examine all possibilities
to help your horses live on as racehorses.

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:34.512
Why do you have to go so far?

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.952
"I don't want them to end here."

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:44.122
That's how I feel.

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:25.263
Hello? I need your help.

00:34:25.763 --> 00:34:27.498
I need an urgent appraisal.

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:39.577
SANNO BUILDING

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:43.448
Arrangements have been finalized
for the disposal of all horses.

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:45.683
All we need now
is the president's approval.

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:55.526
What's your decision?

00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:01.799
Excuse me!

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:05.670
-Mr. Kurisu!
-Sorry for interrupting.

00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:08.473
Can I have just a moment of your time?

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.508
Now?

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:18.716
I've brought
seven years' worth of transactions.

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.219
Upon meticulously examining these,

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:24.055
I've discovered
over 300 suspicious receipts

00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:26.424
and unnatural invoices.

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:32.230
These receipts…

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:36.434
They were all issued using the same
commercially available receipt forms.

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:39.904
Upon verification, I discovered that

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:42.773
most of the recipients
do not actually exist!

00:35:43.407 --> 00:35:46.177
I've also confirmed invoices
from a consulting firm

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:48.980
dealing with the Horse Racing Division
since its inception

00:35:49.046 --> 00:35:54.185
that contain items lacking substance
and charges that appear excessive.

00:35:54.685 --> 00:36:00.458
These were made using fictitious receipts
and kickbacks from a consulting firm.

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:02.093
An act of embezzlement!

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.729
Mr. President, what does this mean?

00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:07.565
-I want an explanation!
-Sir.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.902
The President is not involved.

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:12.470
What?

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:15.373
Could you explain it to me?

00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:17.775
Mr. Kaneshiro?

00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:21.479
I got a research firm I work closely with

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:24.415
to examine the handwriting
on the receipts.

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:27.018
The consultants have also
completed their investigation.

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:28.386
Mr. Kaneshiro.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.422
Your embezzlement is clear for all to see.

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:32.990
This embezzlement

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:36.093
has been occurring regularly
for at least the past five years.

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:39.063
If the total amount were to be returned,

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:43.634
it would be enough to finance the training
costs for the President's current horses.

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:44.902
Sir.

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:50.141
I request that the investigation report
I submitted be withdrawn.

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:55.446
I hereby certify that President Sanno
was not at fault in this matter.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.183
The Horse Racing Division
still has a shot at--

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.184
Wait a minute!

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:01.686
It still has a shot?

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.020
Wait!

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.592
I have a proposal.

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:13.231
Royal Human runs side businesses
alongside the main temp company,

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:16.667
Horse Racing and Food and Drinks,

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:18.469
which I'll reevaluate.

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:20.037
If the situation calls for it,

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:22.306
I'll close them.

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:23.474
But…

00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:27.678
Of course, I won't abandon
the employees who'll be affected.

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:30.815
I'll move them all back to HQ.

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:33.784
But, sir, your Food and Drinks Division…

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:35.453
We are a temp company.

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:40.858
Better a good workforce
than some good restaurants, right?

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:41.993
Yutaro.

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:47.198
I'm so sorry.

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:55.673
After that, Eiji Kurisu
resigned from his accounting firm.

00:37:56.907 --> 00:38:00.711
While it appeared he was taking
responsibility for losing a major client,

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:04.215
the resignation was at his own request.

00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:05.950
Kurisu…

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:11.355
saved Kozo Sanno and his ten horses,
yet he lost his job.

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:17.328
Yes, Hayashida speaking.

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:19.497
Yes?

00:38:22.566 --> 00:38:25.536
ROYAL FIGHT

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:33.911
Do you have a dream?

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:54.765
Yes?

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:56.434
Mr. Accountant, it's me.

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:18.889
Welcome.

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:22.793
-Welcome.
-Mr. Accountant!

00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:26.197
Actually, I'm no longer…

00:39:26.263 --> 00:39:27.765
Welcome to Niigata.

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:29.533
This way.

00:39:30.334 --> 00:39:34.271
There's a vacant horse owner seat,
left by Kaneshiro.

00:39:34.338 --> 00:39:35.706
You take it.

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.475
Welcome.

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:39.443
Thank you. Welcome.

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:42.646
NIIGATA RACECOURSE

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:48.052
What is it that draws people in so much?

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:50.187
Both those who bet
and those who are bet on,

00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:52.390
most people end up in the red.

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:55.926
Even if they don't lose,
they don't gain either.

00:39:56.527 --> 00:40:00.698
Very rarely do some horse owners
break even overall.

00:40:01.432 --> 00:40:05.703
They are the chosen few.

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:11.976
It's all the more reason why
we can't make it without money.

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:15.980
For the slightest boost to your win rate,

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:19.150
you need a lot of horses
with good pedigrees.

00:40:19.216 --> 00:40:20.117
But you know,

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:24.655
it takes a ton of money to buy
a lot of horses with good pedigrees.

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:26.390
Just like him.

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:30.861
But horse racing is more than just that.

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:35.699
The amount of money you bet
doesn't determine the outcome.

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:37.835
Rather,

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:41.205
there's a fleeting moment
when both horse and jockey…

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:46.076
I mean, when every single person
involved with the horse

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:49.079
becomes one with the horse.

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:52.082
What I call perfect unity.

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:55.653
Sometimes that can
turn everything upside down.

00:40:57.488 --> 00:41:00.991
Once you taste that, you just can't stop.

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:03.928
You'd forget having lost millions.

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:07.565
Forgetting that is majorly problematic.

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:11.068
You truly are a tax accountant.

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:16.974
Hello.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:19.944
Let's see how the favorite fares
on the straight.

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:24.114
About race distances, going forward…

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:29.286
Tadokoro.

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:31.989
Hello.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.358
Congrats.

00:41:40.498 --> 00:41:42.299
Are you a new staffer here?

00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:44.768
-What?
-For Royal.

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:47.304
No, I was just called out here.

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:48.205
FREELANCE WRITER

00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:51.509
Well, I've heard rumors
that there was quite a bit of drama,

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:55.112
where all his horses were almost put down.

00:41:58.382 --> 00:41:59.884
It's a small world.

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:02.086
Hang on.

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:04.722
Here. I'm Taira.

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:11.829
I wondered if someone new stepped in
to shore up the company.

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:13.430
Personally,

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:17.935
I'd like Mr. Sanno
to stay in the horse racing world.

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:22.006
Why would you like him to stay?

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.376
He's interesting.

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:29.213
It needs a guy like him.

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:32.716
Mr. Kurisu.

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:36.086
Thank you very much.

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:37.588
What?

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:41.058
The owner said it's thanks to you
that Fight could run today.

00:42:42.793 --> 00:42:44.662
Therefore, I'm really grateful.

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.230
I knew it!

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:49.300
-No, I really didn't…
-I'll see you.

00:42:50.534 --> 00:42:53.070
-Thank you again.
-I didn't…

00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:01.712
Why not come work here now?

00:43:08.285 --> 00:43:10.854
Any others that might try to run away?

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.823
No. Don't worry about it.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.325
Enjoy the show.

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:18.128
Race Seven, jockeys.

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:19.830
Thank you.

00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:21.832
Thank you.

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:23.767
WING DOYLE

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:29.139
-Be careful of drifting on corners.
-Okay.

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:44.254
All right, Fight.

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:48.726
Show everyone what you can do.

00:43:57.401 --> 00:43:58.736
ROYAL FIGHT

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:00.938
Third Niigata Race Meeting, Day Eight.

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:11.548
2,000 meters, 12 horses,

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:13.751

Niigata Racecourse Race Seven.
This is a maiden race for three-year-olds.

00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:04.862
A 2,000-meter inner turf course
with 12 horses on the tracks.

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:07.998
First, the favorite,
Number 11, Wing Doyle,

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:10.300
has now smoothly entered the gate.

00:46:10.367 --> 00:46:12.970
-He seems a bit agitated…
-The odds are 2.3 to 1.

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:17.674
Number Five, Garland Tact, listening
to the jockey again, moves into the gate.

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:20.444
The Niigata Racecourse turf
is set to Course A.

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.980
The running rail is not in use,
excellent track conditions.

00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:25.382
From the fourth corner to the straight…

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:29.887
"Wing Doyle, no blind spots."

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:32.523

-Number Four, Royal Fight…
-I'm counting on you, Sugahara.

00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:39.596
-Wasn't his entry smooth?
-Yes.

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:41.498
Enji Dome has safely entered the gate.

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:45.169
All the horses are in position.

00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:51.208
The red light is on and they're off!

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:53.744
All 12 have begun the race!

00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:56.146
They're vying to lead the pack!

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.715
In the lead right now is Number 11.

00:46:58.782 --> 00:47:00.951
-All right. Come on.
-Wing Doyle has taken the lead!

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:02.486
Wing Doyle, dashing ahead!

00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:05.322
With the pink helmet,
the favorite, Wing Doyle takes the lead!

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:07.224
Next is Number Ten, Enji Dome.

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:10.594
Then Number Two, Lively Mine.
Wing Doyle is in the lead, followed by…

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.863
-Which place?
-Mine's in fourth place.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.666
-All right, that's a good spot.
-Cosmos Blaze in third, then Lively Mine!

00:47:15.732 --> 00:47:17.501
-Royal Fight remains in fourth…
-Fight.

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:19.036
-He's followed by Velvet Dance.
-Fight!

00:47:19.102 --> 00:47:22.773
-All twelve are entering a curve.
-Fight!

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.708
Fight!

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:27.344
As they go through the first turn,
they are moving as one.

00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:30.314
In the lead is number 11, Wing Doyle,
with the pink helmet.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.516
In second place is Number Ten, Enji Dome.

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:36.153
In third place is Number Two, Lively Mine,

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.522
Trying to overtake
is Number 12, Cosmos Blaze.

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:41.558
In fifth place is Royal Fight
with the blue helmet, finding a gap!

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:45.395
-By a small margin is Velvet Dance…
-What a great sound.

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:47.631
Tomoya Prime is bunched up in the middle!

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:55.372
PHANTOS

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:57.040
With Elysion Middle setting the pace,

00:47:57.107 --> 00:47:59.409
the 1,000-meter mark was cleared
in one minute, one second!

00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:02.613
Second place is Enji Dome.
Third place is Lively Mine!

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:05.949
Followed by number 12, Cosmos Blaze!

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:07.351
Keep it up!

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:09.720
-Keep it up!
-Wing Doyle is keeping the lead!

00:48:09.786 --> 00:48:12.923
Number 11, Wing Doyle, is in the front.
Next is Number Ten.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.658
That's some skilled riding.

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:17.694
-You can still make it.
-They head to the third curve!

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:19.930
Can Number 11, Wing Doyle, keep the lead?

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:23.867
The midfield pack, including Number Four
Royal Fight is lagging behind a little.

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:25.369
Don't get boxed in!

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:27.571
-In the lead, Number 11, Wing Doyle.
-Come on, Fight!

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:29.539
-Come on!
-Between the third and fourth corners!

00:48:29.606 --> 00:48:32.376
They are now heading
to the final straight track!

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:38.949
Go!

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:40.017
Go for it!

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:42.753
Now is the run that decides it all!

00:48:42.819 --> 00:48:44.588
Only 400 meters left!

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:48.959
After the 400-meter mark, Number Four,
Royal Fight has gained speed!

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:50.761
-In the lead is a pink helmet.
-Go!

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.062
-Go!
-It's Wing Doyle!

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:54.831
They've maintained the lead. Royal Fight…

00:48:56.366 --> 00:48:58.302
goes from sixth to fifth,
now fourth place!

00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.703
Third place now!

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.105
Number Four, Royal Fight,
with the blue helmet!

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:03.240
-Go.
-The outer lane…

00:49:03.307 --> 00:49:05.609
-Royal Fight charges straight ahead!
-Come on!

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:07.411
-Come on!
-Royal Fight and Wing Doyle.

00:49:07.477 --> 00:49:09.279
Which will it be?

00:49:09.346 --> 00:49:11.181
Fight is breaking through!

00:49:11.248 --> 00:49:13.150
-Fight!
-In the blue helmet, Royal Fight is…

00:49:13.216 --> 00:49:14.885
-Come on! Fight!
-He's in second place!

00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:16.386
Good!

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:18.789
-Go!
-Go!

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:21.491
Will Royal Fight make it?
He's gaining ground!

00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:22.426
Hold on!

00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:23.860
Go!

00:49:23.927 --> 00:49:24.928
Go!

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:25.963
Go!

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:27.831
Royal Fight's burst of speed!

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:28.999
Hold on!

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:31.168
-Go!
-Will it be Wing Doyle?

00:49:31.234 --> 00:49:34.071
Or Royal Fight?
It's impossible to call a winner!

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:36.106
-They are now neck and neck!
-Go!

00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:38.375
-Will it be Wing Doyle or Royal Fight?
-Go!

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:39.776
Go!

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:43.814
Wing Doyle and Royal Fight
pass the finish line neck and neck!

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.049
A side-by-side finish!

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:49.219
Is it Wing Doyle or Royal Fight?

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:54.458
Niigata Racecourse Race Seven.

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:58.228
Please wait a moment for the results.

00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:10.107
-Race Seven.
-You did your best.

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:12.509
-First and second place.
-Well played.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.544
First place is…

00:50:15.145 --> 00:50:17.114
-Number 11.
-Oh, man!

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.248
In second place…

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:20.550
is Number Four.

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:23.220
It has been decided.

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:25.956
-First place is Number 11, Wing Doyle.
-Yes!

00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:27.758
In second place is Number Four,
Royal Fight.

00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:29.393
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:32.162
-Number 11, Wing Doyle, was the favorite.
-Thank you.

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:34.798
That concludes Race Seven
at the Niigata Racecourse.

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:38.335
Number Four, Royal Fight,
ran a strong race for second.

00:50:38.402 --> 00:50:40.537
First place goes to Wing Doyle, Number 11.

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.806
The odds were 2.3 to 1.

00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:45.275
Royal Fight coming in second place,

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:48.979
resulted in a high payout
on the Exacta of 4,910 yen.

00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:52.149
Next is Race Eight
of the Niigata Racecourse.

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:54.518
It will begin at exactly 2:00 p.m.

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:12.536
Hello?

00:51:12.602 --> 00:51:15.605
Mr. Kurisu? I'm down here!

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:16.640
What?

00:51:21.211 --> 00:51:23.680
Oh, it's you, Mr. Hayashida.

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:26.583
Thank you very much.

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:28.985
But…

00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:30.353
Really.

00:51:30.987 --> 00:51:32.856
Thank you very much.

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.826
Thank you very much!

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:09.726
Last year,

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:13.096
my father passed away.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.769
He was solely devoted to tax accounting.

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:24.274
He wanted me to take over his trade,

00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:27.711
so he sent me to college in Tokyo.

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:35.418
I followed his advice
and earned my tax accountant license,

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:41.791
and as part of my training,
I joined a large firm.

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:51.434
Then, a few years ago…

00:52:56.239 --> 00:53:01.378
my dad asked me to come and work with him.

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:06.183
At that time, I couldn't bring myself

00:53:06.249 --> 00:53:09.386
to abandon the position
and reputation I had acquired.

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:15.692
I thought I'd join him one day.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.299
Yet, I kept running away from him.

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:27.571
And then, he suddenly collapsed and died.

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:33.210
I'm sure that when he told me to return…

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:37.847
He already had an inkling.

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.118
And yet…

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:44.721
I…

00:53:46.823 --> 00:53:49.226
I ended up betraying him!

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:56.299
If only I could go back to that time…

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:03.206
Since then, for the past year,

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:08.678
I've always regretted that very moment.

00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:12.315
But…

00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:16.253
Today, I realized…

00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:25.028
it's thanks to him
that I am where I am now.

00:54:26.263 --> 00:54:27.998
For the first time…

00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:32.469
as my dad said, I became of service.

00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:37.407
I've done something
that earned someone's gratitude.

00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:44.614
Don't say that to me.

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:47.050
Say it to your dad.

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:54.891
But I'm glad you told me.

00:54:56.226 --> 00:55:02.932
I don't dislike people
who can't get over their dad dying.

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:07.704
What's your name again?

00:55:09.939 --> 00:55:10.974
Kurisu.

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:13.310
Eiji Kurisu.

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.247
"Chris," huh?

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:21.117
Nice, Chris.

00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:23.753
Okay, Chris.

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:26.923
-What is that?
-Want to work for me?

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.260
Want to come over to my place?

00:55:32.862 --> 00:55:34.130
You've got no place to go, right?

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:37.367
Then come on over.

00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:43.473
But before that,
go pay your respects to your dad.

00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:46.109
You have a lot to tell him.

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:55.018
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:57.120
Hey.

00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:59.989
I wonder if horses know when they win.

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.258
Once they cross the finish line,

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:06.329
"I've won! I got first place!"

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:08.898
Do you think they understand that?

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:12.669
I don't know.

00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:18.842
If you ask trainers or jockeys,

00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:23.980
some will say they do
and some will say they don't.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.685
It depends on the horse, but…

00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:31.588
I think they do.

00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:34.491
When no one is running ahead,

00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:37.961
and when no one has crossed
the finish line yet,

00:56:38.027 --> 00:56:39.529
you'll be the first to sprint through.

00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:43.032
Even horses must feel great.

00:56:44.934 --> 00:56:48.405
I want to let them experience that.

00:56:50.673 --> 00:56:52.308
I'm dreaming of the peak.

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:56.012
I want to win
the nation's top Grade I race

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:58.181
and make our horse the best in Japan.

00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:02.685
At the Arima Kinen.

00:57:05.288 --> 00:57:06.890
It's not just about skill.

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:10.693
You can't get there
without the fans' vote.

00:57:12.595 --> 00:57:13.930
It's the toughest dream.

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:17.634
Want to give it a try?

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:23.807
In exchange, promise me one thing.

00:57:26.509 --> 00:57:28.244
You must never betray me.

00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:31.147
Never.

00:57:37.654 --> 00:57:38.855
Understood.

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:49.999
Did Dad win?

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:51.034
I'll call you back.

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.368
Second place.

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:54.838
-That's lame. He should've won.
-I'm sorry.

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:57.207
The tax accountant acted unexpectedly.

00:57:58.041 --> 00:57:59.876
Think about what to do next.

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:03.580
You have to protect that company.

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:05.748
All right. Let's go.

00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:07.650
-Good work.
-See you.

00:58:07.717 --> 00:58:08.952
-Yes.
-Good job.

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:13.623
"Narrowly defeated, Royal Fight

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:17.994
won second place overall."

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:23.266
August 7th, 2011.

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:27.737
That was the day he'd later recount to me.

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:33.109
"Before I knew it, I was running.
I couldn't help but run.

00:58:34.077 --> 00:58:37.881
If I reached out,
I could surely grasp a brand-new dream.

00:58:38.448 --> 00:58:41.518
That's how I felt at that moment."

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:57.200
Win one central race within the year.

00:58:57.267 --> 00:58:58.968
Reevaluate. We need a trainer who can win.

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.336
Do you hate horse racing?

00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:01.337
I loathe it.

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:03.506
I want Fight to win.

00:59:03.573 --> 00:59:04.774
You can win this way!

00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:05.808
