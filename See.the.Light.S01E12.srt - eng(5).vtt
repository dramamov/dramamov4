00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.200
What's taking you so long?

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.400
You've been picking up someone for so long.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.640
Good things take time.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.680
As long as I can see you

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.000
Coming

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.520
Where are the people in 3589? Why are you alone?

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.200
Where are you? Why are you alone?

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.280
I'm sorry, Xiao Li.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
Hu Juan went north.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.280
She's on the train.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.360
What?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.360
Sumire.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.920
I'm leaving. Bye.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.840
You don't have to come to me.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.199
Just take me as a ray of smoke

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.520
Forget me.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.040
Your life should be like the little white flowers at my door.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.400
Pure and shiny forever.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.240
I hope

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.600
we don't have a broken family

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.960
We didn't have such a terrible childhood.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.600
I love you forever.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.400
Why?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.600
Why doesn't she want to see me

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.079
even if she went to the north?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.680
What's wrong with you?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.120
You're a man.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.480
Can't you stop her?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.720
Let's go.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.160
Let's go after her.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.160
The train has left.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.920
How?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.160
Where did she go?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.800
I didn't ask.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.720
You know nothing.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.720
What do I need you for?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.040
Everyone has the right

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.480
to choose their own life.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.280
This is her choice.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.520
We should respect her.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.280
We should ask her face to face.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.960
Let's go.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.320
Go to the station and find them one by one.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.200
Jin-kyung.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.880
Yan is right.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.160
Maybe she really

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.840
wants to say goodbye to her past.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.000
I won't disturb you anymore

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.320
and miss her all the time.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.600
might be the best for her.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.880
Thank you.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.760
Thank you.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.079
Thank you.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.800
Let me take you home.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.440
Get in.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.040
You messed up picking up someone.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.240
Are you done?

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.840
What else do you want?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.600
Do you want her to know

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.000
her sister killed herself

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.560
to not drag her down?

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.440
What?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.760
What?

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.120
You promised yesterday.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.120
Jin-kyung.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.160
You can't see other people's choices

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.440
in your position.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.480
Hu Juan can't live long.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.360
She's still alive

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.600
is just hanging on.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.880
That's Hu Li.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.640
Now that she knows that she's doing well,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.240
she'll be relieved.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.280
No.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.440
What about Hu Qiang?

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.960
Anyone there?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.640
Please let me out.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.760
Anyone?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.040
Please let me out.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.760
I won't buy kids anymore.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.680
Why don't you send him to the police station?

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.400
He likes to raise people like dogs.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.640
Give him this chance.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.880
You're torturing him.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.760
He'll die.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.680
Someone sent him meals regularly.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.240
He won't die. Let's go.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.320
We're not law enforcement.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.840
How can we punish him instead of the law?

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.440
Lu Jinjing.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.680
You didn't tell me when you were looking for Feng Lei's evidence.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.600
You didn't say anything

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.880
you didn't say anything.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.560
It's Hu Qiang's turn now.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.160
What's wrong? You can't get over it?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.000
You're a saint.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.760
You're upholding justice.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.680
You are bullied.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.120
Wang Yu was bullied.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.880
When Hu Juan and Hu Li were bullied,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.080
Where is justice?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.880
But this is not helping.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.280
This is not helping.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.240
Hu Li who lost her childhood shouldn't be helped.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.720
The young Hu Juan shouldn't be helped.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.200
Your sister Wang Yu shouldn't be helped.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.960
In this situation,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.920
we can only rely on ourselves.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.840
You've been with us for so long.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.440
you've never thought

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.600
why there is a way

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.680
Like this?

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.920
Only in this way

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.200
we can protect ourselves.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.880
Only in this way

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.960
the era of everyone being treated fairly

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.480
can come.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.320
The person you think is

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.200
is to find someone to complain.

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:37.000
If changing someone

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.159
to change someone,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.360
youâ€™ll still work in the company.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.880
Let me out.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.520
Officers.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.120
You're finally here.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.320
Release him!

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.560
Come out!

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.000
Hurry up.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.440
Come here.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.680
Have you seen her?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.080
Yes.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.520
I don't think so.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.640
Have you seen it?

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.400
Yes, I have.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.920
He's with Mr. Geum Mu.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:32.760
Who is Geum Mu?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:35.880
Boss.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.280
Go after him.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:37.840
Let's go.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.000
Let's go.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.120
Boss.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.280
A bowl of wonton

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.040
Wait a minute

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.840
It'll be ready soon.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.560
Okay.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.840
You've been with us for so long.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.840
have you ever thought about why?

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.000
Is there a way to pay back?

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.880
We just fight back.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.000
Only in this way

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.000
we can protect ourselves.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.760
Only in this way

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.480
the era of everyone being treated fairly

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.400
can come.
