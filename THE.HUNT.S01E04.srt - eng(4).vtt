Sure.

These are for you.

I don't want them.

Why?

The flowers have been blown away.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.600
It's okay.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.670
Get a bucket full of water.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.600
Put the flowers in it.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.660
In a couple of days,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.570

This must have cost a lot.

Didn't cost anything.

Brought over on a boat.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.270
The captain gave it to me.

Next time, I'll transport something else
and make more money.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.240
How could you possibly make so much

When we earn enough,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.880
I need to go out for a bit!

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.710
Yet you won't let me!

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:53.240
My period

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.590
is late.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.000
What's late?

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.630
I thought I couldn't get pregnant anymore.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.880
Uncle Chen has been arrested.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.230
One after another.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.030
It never ends.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.640
How will we raise our child if it's born?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.330
It's not the right time.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.280
Well, tomorrow morning,

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.800
I'll come and take you

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.880
to the clinic

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.090
to get an abortion.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.920
Ximei, are you okay?

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.760
You shouldn't smoke.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.730
I'm having an abortion anyway.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.770
It doesn't matter.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.230
Uncle Chen once said

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.280
I had been through too much,

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.080
and my body had long been ruined.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.110
This might be

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:23.360
my last child.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.960
If you really want this baby,

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.190
keep it.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.630
He said...

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:49.480
Never mind him.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.400
It's your body.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:57.640
It's your decision.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:59.920
I'm just a woman,

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.770
with little education.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:04.400
I can't earn much money.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.260
How can I raise a child?

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.860
If the baby is born,

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.920
I'll raise it.
