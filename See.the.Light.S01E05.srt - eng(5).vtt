WEBVTT

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.400
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.480
Come here.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.840
Director,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.240
This invitation

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.880
Take it.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.880
Tonight,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.480
Mr. Chen and Mr. Niu will come.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.120
Do your best.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.360
Director,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.400
Can I not go?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.520
Lu Jinjing.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320
Don't push your luck.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.320
I haven't settled with you

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.920
about your absence last time.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.000
You're a girl.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.200
You should dress yourself up.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.760
Look at your outfit.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.440
Look at you.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.960
Okay, it's settled.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.520
Go.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.720
Don't take me if you think it's ugly.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.120
I read in the newspaper that day

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.400
is simple, loyal and loyal.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.479
In fact,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.840
Shanghai is prosperous.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.840
Ten miles Market.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.120
It's a great harvest.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.400
There's Rong Nai.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.720
Speaking of which,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.400
Mr. Chen and Mr. Niu.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.920
Let me introduce.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.280
the best two young employees

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.280
of Shanghai Firm.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.520
Lu Jinjing and Xu Jia Jia.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.280
Why are you so confused?

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.280
What are you waiting for?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.360
Say hello to Mr. Chen and Mr. Niu.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.040
Hello, Mr. Chen. Hello, Mr. Niu.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.680
Hello, Mr. Chen. Hello, Mr. Niu.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.880
I've long heard that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.920
are the leaders of Shanghai business.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.840
Thanks for your care.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.680
What a sweet girl.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.280
Mr. Niu, Jiajia

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.040
is not only beautiful and clever,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.400
And she is the best at telling the truth.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.520
Jia Jia, come here.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.920
Miss Lu,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.760
Have a drink.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.200
Mr Chen.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.720
I'm sorry.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.520
I can't drink.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.440
It's okay.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.480
The wine is not intoxicating.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.880
Director Hong.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.440
Your employee is a bit shy.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.760
No problem.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.720
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.000
Do you still want to work?

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.280
Brother.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.360
Come on

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.920
Let's take this chance

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.000
Let's

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.280
to celebrate.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.760
Come on.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:23.720
Come on

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.240
Come on.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.000
In Shanghai,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.840
all things are snatched.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.880
So,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.400
we can make money together.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.640
Let's share it.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.280
Come on.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.600
Come on.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.840
I knew it.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.520
The wine is not drunk.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.840
Excuse me.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.880
I need to use the bathroom.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.400
They are all here.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.480
Yes, Chief Zhou.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.680
These are all the guest records in recent years.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.399
Zhou Cheng Yong.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.560
Lu Jinjing.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.320
Why are you here?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.720
None of your business.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.240
Let me ask you.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.480
Where is Wang Yu?

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.920
Also,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.400
you should know

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.320
who drank with Feng Lei.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.280
Where did she go?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.760
I don't know.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.240
I've seen her.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.040
If you still think she's righteous,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.080
I can tell you.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.800
She's more dangerous than anyone.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.320
Be careful.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.560
You don't usually wear this?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.320
Are you...

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.400
Yes.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.080
I have to wear it for you now.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.400
What's wrong?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.120
Did someone bully you?

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.200
Who is that?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.920
Left.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.840
Gao Hongshan, leader of political and business.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.360
The other one.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.560
Director Zhou Cheng Yong

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.960
Zhou.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.160
Your father?

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.040
As expected, a dragon gives birth to a dragon.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.040
The mouse's son knows how to dig a hole.

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.840
Lu Jin-kyung.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.560
Why are you standing there?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.640
Come here.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.720
You...

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.040
Brother, you don't know.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.000
That time,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.159
at Paramount.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.240
Mr. Niu. Mr. Niu.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.159
I haven't made a toast to you today.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.200
I'll drink this.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.720
Okay.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.280
Ms. Lu is a good drinker.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.080
You got it.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.760
Here, Miss Lu.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.240
Cheers.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.520
Mr Chen.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.960
I can't drink anymore.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.520
What's wrong?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.720
It's delicious.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.800
Don't you respect Mr. Niu?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.600
You just had a drink for Ms Xu.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.120
How about letting Ms Xu

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.760
drink it for you?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.760
No, no, no.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.360
I'll drink.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.159
You're a good drinker.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.440
Come on.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.960
Tonight,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.960
get drunk tonight.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.840
Let me help you get some rest.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.840
Let's go to the bathroom.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.120
Slow down.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.720
How impressive!

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.120
Don't move, baby.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.040
Get lost!

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.520
Get lost.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.760
Don't move, baby.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.000
Baby.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.720
Let go of me!

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.240
Let go!

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.040
Why are you here?

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.200
Let's see if you're here to sleep with me.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.520
If so, I'll sweep the yellow.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.440
or I'll save you.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.480
Jia.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.400
Jia Jia.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.400
What's wrong?

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.000
Come with me.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.440
What's wrong?

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:40.840
Who are you?

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.440
What do you want?

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.679
Who are you?

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.640
Do you know who I am?

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.200
I'm Chief Zhou Mu of the Municipal Bureau.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.200
I'm warning you.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.040
Donâ€™t do anything stupid.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.720
Chief.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.880
Even the Chief will die here today.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.520
Go!

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.000
Go!

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.880
Keep up.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.440
Zhou Mu.
