WEBVTT

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.440
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.319
for supporting our police station.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.360
Next, Mr. Gao will speak to you.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.880
Everyone,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.240
Up to now,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.039
the ships at the crossing dock

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.039
from London.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720
These

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.640
are the results

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.920
by all of you.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.880
I, Gao Hongshan,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.400
as the co-representative of the political and business world,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.080
Thank you for your hard work.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.479
So,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.960
in my name,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.120
in my own name.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.600
200,000 won.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.000
Keep up the good work.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.720
Thank you.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.480
Mu.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.640
Talk to Uncle Gao.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.440
Put your work aside.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:33.680
Gao.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.720
He has no manners at all.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.400
Do you hear me?

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.720
Zhou.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.360
It's okay.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.480
Mu is a detective now.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.480
It's normal.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.560
Right, Mu?

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.720
By the way,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.120
Nanjing has a few central positions vacant.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.560
Your dad and I want to recommend you.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.720
Uncle Gao.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.800
I'm a detective now.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.240
It's good. I don't want to be a leader yet.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.920
I can't do it either.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.080
Nonsense.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.480
Do you understand?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.600
Do you think everyone has this chance?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.880
Zhou.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.240
It's good that he has his own ideas.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.120
Also,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.680
listen to Mu in the future.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.040
Don't be so impatient.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.440
Okay, I'll listen to your opinion.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.680
Tell me what you think.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.680
How could you be late

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.560
such an important meeting?

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.640
I went to catch the traffickers.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.480
Is catching human traffickers more important

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.000
or the commendation meeting?

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.920
He may have something to do with Miao.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.880
Mu.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.120
Today is Miao’s 16th birthday.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.880
Come back early.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.240
Miaomiao.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.920
Miaomiao.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.560
Put him in the car.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.040
Someone's coming.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.760
Drive!

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.480
Go. Go.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.680
Miaomiao.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.400
Miaomiao.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.920
Miaomiao.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.240
Miaomiao.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.680
Miaomiao.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.720
Uncle Gao.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.920
I have no appetite today.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.360
As for being a leader,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.840
I'm still young.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.920
I don't want to have tea in the office so early.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.360
Take your time.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.880
I have work to do.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.640
Excuse me.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.120
Mu.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.200
Mu.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.440
Mu.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.240
Yan.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.880
The human trafficker Tiger Li was arrested.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.440
Someone testified that he was involved in a missing person case seven years ago.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.760
We'll know

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.080
and we'll know.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.920
I'll go take a look.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.960
Who are you?

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.600
Why did you tie me here?

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.880
Are you crazy?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.880
Do you know who I am?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.360
I'm Tiger Li from Suzhou River.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.240
I'm a tiger.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.120
King of Beasts.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.360
I'll bite whoever I catch.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.720
Seven years ago,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.600
Do you know the girl who jumped off the building?

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.080
It's a misunderstanding.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.080
What do I know?

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.480
Seven years ago?

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.840
Oh my god.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.159
Please let me go.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.960
I have a wife and children.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.480
They can't live without me.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.960
I have to take care of my wife.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.000
They all need me.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.080
Brother! Brother!

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.159
Hey.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.840
What tiger Lee?

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.440
This is a paper tiger.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.440
He's not a good guy either.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.400
What should we do?

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.880
Throw it to the police.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.280
As usual.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.520
Why does she appear in every case?

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.000
In the dark,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.160
every photo of her

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.760
has a bloody story behind it.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.880
On Zhou Mu's wall,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.440
on Zhou Mu's wall

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.880
is related to Miaomiao’s disappearance.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.520
What’s the connection

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.040
between these complicated cases?

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.040
Although Si Jiali and Zhou Mu are both in the dark,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.280
the game of fate

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.080
has already tied them together.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:26.600
Hit!

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.080
One.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.600
A big hotel at the Bund.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.360
Guest Zhao Wenyu Chen Huafeng Lv Army

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:22.640
Ben guest Ding Haibo Zhou Guanghua

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:23.600
Girls, take your heart, Ning Lijun, Zhang Liting.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.080
Photographer assistant Liu Xiaobin Zhan Xiaolin Yang Rui

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:56.840
Props, Yang, Yu, Hu Jianpeng, Wu Zhiguang.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.040
Wang Adong, Jin Mengjie.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.280
Lighting assistant Li Xun Bo Zhang Junbiao Yan Dengke

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:02.600
Cao Guangli Deng Wei

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:06.800
Wu, OK. Chen Guodong, Li, Bo, Zhao Zihao.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.160
Zhang Chuan, Wang Zhiqiang, Ma Ming.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.480
