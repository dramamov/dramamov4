[THE HUNT]

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:58.420
[2010, Weihai]

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.570
The Second Winter Tourism Industry Expo

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.710
will open in our city on January 4.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.240
This year's theme is

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.259
North and South Connected,

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.789
Mountains and Seas United.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.800
A grand fireworks display

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.280
will be held at 7:00 p.m.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.540
Liu, out patrolling the mountain again?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.060
I've checked the lower areas.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.210
I'll rest for a while

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.960
and then head up to check the top.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.560
If you freeze out there,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.680
your pay won't even be enough

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.010
to cover medical bills.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.030
Here.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.970
It's good to be young—

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.680
full of endless energy.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.190
Looks like it might snow.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.000
I'd better hurry

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.680
to the small restaurant down the mountain
and order a few dishes.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.960
I'll buy a bottle of baijiu too.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.800
It's cold at night.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.800
We can have a drink

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.470
to warm ourselves up.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.030
Mr. Wang,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.970
we shouldn't drink while on duty, right?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.960
We're just security guards,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.040
not police officers.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.720
Don't worry.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.430
It's freezing.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.490
The captain won't come to check on us.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.450
I look quite like a cop.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.950
What a stench.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.280
Can you handle it?

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.710
Maybe we should ask Wang to come to help.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.240
Let me tell you, Wang is

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.790
even worse at this than I am.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.980
I'll have it done in 5 minutes.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.450
Quick, get the mop!

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.840
Xiangdong,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.350
are we friends or not?

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.740
If I'm in trouble,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.159
will you help me?

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.680
What's wrong?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.980
No one else

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.560
can know about this,

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.360
not even Ximei.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.750
Only you and me.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.910
If anyone else finds out,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.040
I might not be able to live.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.630
If we're true friends,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.630
help me with this.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.240
Tomorrow at 4 p.m.,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.670
go to my place and pick up a wooden box.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.270
After dark,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.560
take it to the old shack

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.090
at the peak of Mount Fufeng.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.210
Before you go,
take the old road near the signal tower.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.070
What's

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.800
inside the box?

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.860
[That accident from years ago
replays in a nightmare,]

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.370
[like tiny cracks
spreading across a frozen lake.]

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.540
[Episode 1: The box]

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.370
Mentor.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.920
Go ahead.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.440
An elderly couple on the second floor

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.270
reported a clogged toilet drain.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.000
When they cleared it,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.070
they pulled out a mess of debris

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.150
from the main pipe—

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.270
some hair

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.200
and half of an ear.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.740
Human.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.970
They suspect it's a dismemberment case.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.090
The forensic team is already inside,

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.510
checking the primary scene.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.040
Mr. Meng.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.290
Over there.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.120
Mr. Niu.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.600
Anything else besides the ear?

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.159
Not for now.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.770
The scene's poorly preserved.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.720
No clear signs

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.920
of a struggle either.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.680
Anyone here?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.780
[Xiaojun]

Xiaojun.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.650
Xiaojun.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.020
Who's there?

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.910
Liu!

Liu!

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:06.610
Officer,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.390
what's going on?

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.000
We received a report

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.300
from a security guard at Mount Fufeng.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.390
Was it you?

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.650
No.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.370
Are there other security guards here?

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.590
There's one more.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.700
He was just here a moment ago.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.320
You haven't had dinner at this hour?

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.140
We're from
the Guanhai Criminal Investigation Unit.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.740
Take a look.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.740
Something happened downstairs.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.600
Have you heard about it?

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.660
This has nothing to do with my family.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:09.630
Yes.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:10.930
But your units

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.280
share the same pipeline.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.080
We'd like to go in and take a look.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.010
Wait.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.970
Come, you go in first.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.340
Bring the luminol reagent.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.280
What's your name?

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.960
Wu Ximei.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.150
How to write

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.440
those Chinese characters?

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.840
Go notify

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.670
the neighboring units

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.890
we'll investigate in their houses later.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.500
Okay.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.130
How many people live here?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.390
Three.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.300
Me,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.620
my husband, and my son.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.460
What's your husband's name?

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:11.720
Cao Xiaojun.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.010
"Xiao" as in small, "Jun" as in soldier.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.080
But on his ID card,
it's "Jun" as in gentleman.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.600
Anything unusual at home recently?

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.360
What time did you and your husband

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.720
leave home today?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
You suspect me?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.550
We're asking every household.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.670
It's standard procedure.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.960
Yes.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.240
We ask every household these questions.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.710
I don't remember the exact time.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.030
In the morning,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.270
when I took Tianbao to school,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.420
Xiaojun was still at home.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.670
At noon, Tianbao was at after-school care.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.930
When I came back,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.440
Xiaojun was already gone.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.170
Tianbao is your child?

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.410
You're not from here?

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.030
I'm from Nanyang.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:01.960
Does Cao Xiaojun usually

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.090
come home this late?

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.250
Xiaojun works in moving services.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.990
He's always running around.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.570
When others are on leave

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.840
or on holiday,

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.000
he's at his busiest.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.670
He works from dawn to dusk.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:14.920
I'm never sure when he'll be home.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.720
I'm used to it.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.750
And what do you do?

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:19.800
Cleaning.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.440
Where?

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.120
Dahu Advertising Studio,

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.600
No. 20 on Huanshan Road.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:29.440
What time do you usually go to work?

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.550
I go once in the morning

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.010
and once in the afternoon.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.200
I get off work at about 6 p.m.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.870
What time did you go this afternoon?

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.420
I left a little after 3 p.m.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.480
and arrived at the company at 4 p.m.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.090
What about the time in between?

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.260
Working on small handcrafts.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.450
Where's your child?

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.250
At Ms. Li's place next door.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.960
He gets out of school early,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.619
so he waits for us at her place.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:08.930
This way?

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:11.400
The unit at the very end.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.270
Wu and her husband

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.670
are quite busy with work.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:15.760
Our children

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.130
are classmates,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.640
and we're neighbors.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.130
It's convenient

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.400
for me to pick up and drop off the child.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.119
So I help her pick up her child.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.750
The one in the sweater

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.310
is our Lele.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.000
That one is Tianbao

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.150
from Unit 312.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.710
Is something going on with their family?

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.170
No,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.600
just routine inquiries.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.480
Our 2 families

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.590
only started visiting more often

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.000
in the last month or 2.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:42.880
Usually,

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.130
it's Cao's friend

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.960
who helps him

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.640
pick up and drop off the child.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.630
They're closer.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.630
Friend?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.590
Who is this?

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.550
Xiaojun's coworker.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.210
Do you usually visit often?

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.310
Not really.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.480
He's in this picture

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:01.960
with your family of 3,

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.560
yet you don't interact much?

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.180
Tianbao is a still kid.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.610
Maybe...

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.070
he happened to be there
when Tianbao drew this.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.400
I don't quite remember.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.270
His...

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.720
His eyebrow...

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.590
There's a scar here.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.110
That friend of his

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.170
isn't a bad person.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.490
And he's even-tempered.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.460
He bought

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.260
toys and stuff for Tianbao.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.680
Tianbao would

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.720
carry them over

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.870
happily to our place

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.270
and show off

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.100
to our Lele.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:36.740
When was the last time

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.780
you saw him?

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.540
He hasn't been around for a while.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.720
Ms. Li.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.880
That's...

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.220
That's not true.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:46.820
Today,

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.960
I saw him coming out

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.200
of Xiaojun's place.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160
Around what time?

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.670
Around...

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.030
Around 3 or 4 p.m.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.550
How did he seem then?

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.630
Anything unusual?

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.540
Who are you?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.470
He's a police officer.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.270
We're investigating the case

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.160
in Unit 212 downstairs.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.360
If you know anything,

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.440
please cooperate with our investigation.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.240
I...

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.990
saw him

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.160
carrying

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.500
a large box

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.440
out of the house.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:19.770
I thought

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.080
since he

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.900
and Xiaojun's family are close,

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.990
I didn't think much of it.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.480
Mr. Niu.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.150
Anything?

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.820
Mind if I check the inner room?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.590
Go ahead.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.110
Same as Unit 212,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.750
no clear signs

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.130
of a struggle.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.670
The toilet area showed some reaction,

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.470
but the trace amount is minimal.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.270
No matter how you look at it,

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.960
it doesn't look like a murder scene.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.200
There are more units inside.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.640
I'll hurry and check them all.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.440
Okay. Thanks for your hard work.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.440
Mr. Meng.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.230
We've got something.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.790
Just when we entered the room,

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:02.550
she said there's a box

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.880
missing from this spot.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:04.960
What kind of box?

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.470
How big?

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.230
About... About this big.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.460
Painted red on the outside.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.110
This is strange.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.830
Everything in the box is still here.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.030
Only the box is gone.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.160
Was there anything valuable inside?

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.220
Just these things.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.450
Describe

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.500
the box's specific features

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.070
to me.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.590
About half a person's height.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.720
Very old,

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.720
but very sturdy.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:31.860
Mentor.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.790
This afternoon,

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.420
a resident in Unit 313

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.370
saw a man called Ni Xiangdong

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.340
coming in and out of here,

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.420
carrying a box.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.720
Ni Xiangdong?

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.540
Is this him?

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.270
Yes.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.350
How many keys do you have to your place?

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.110
Just 3.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.240
One for me,

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.630
one for Xiaojun,

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.350
and one at Ms. Li's place.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.920
Does he have a car?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.720
He has a used van.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.440
Here's what you do—

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.880
write down Ni Xiangdong's

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.680
and Cao Xiaojun's

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.410
phone numbers and names for me.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.920
You go check the license plate number

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.050
of that van quickly.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:04.830
Understood.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.240
Qin K77651.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:09.030
[Ni Xiangdong]

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.140
The suspect's vehicle spotted.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:19.560
[Police]

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.520
License plate number: Qin K77651.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:54.630
Xiaojun.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:56.660
Xiaojun.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.530
Who are you?

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.880
What are you doing here?

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.350
Where's Cao Xiaojun?

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:24.970
I'm asking who you are!

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.700
I'm asking who you are!

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:27.900
Don't move!

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:28.610
Who are you?

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:29.900
Why are you here?

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:30.650
I don't know.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.510
Where is Cao Xiaojun?

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:33.240
I don't know.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.780
Chief, we've arrived.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:39.820
Help!

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:40.930
Help!

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.730
He Yuan is keeping watch
at the foot of the mountain.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:14.640
Song and I

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.400
are heading to the reported location.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.730
All roads up and down Mount Fufeng

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:18.790
have been blocked.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:20.240
Good.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.570
The person is probably in this area.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.020
This area?

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.700
Do you know how big this area is?

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.360
The mountains are high,
and the forest is dense.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:54.990
What's going on here?

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:55.350
[Police]

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.960
What happened?

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.220
This is the patrol guard at Mount Fufeng.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:59.240
He was attacked

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.750
after reporting to the police.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.840
The attacker was brutal.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.500
Has the attacker been caught?

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.540
Let me introduce you to each other.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.370
This is Tong Hao.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.830
This is He Yuan. Call her Ms. He.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:07.260
Ms. He.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.180
Who hit you?

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.000
Did you see the attacker's face?

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.830
No.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.810
Alright, get him

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:15.690
to the hospital quickly.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.880
[Police]

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.750
Be careful on the way down.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:18.160
Okay.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.350
[Police]

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.160
Officer,

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.340
I need to use the bathroom.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.040
Mentor,

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.240
something doesn't add up.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.740
If Cao Xiaojun was in the box,

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.640
why was only an ear thrown

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.680
in the drain?

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.900
Carrying a box in broad daylight

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.830
to dispose of a body?

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:30.790
And if he was disposing of a body,

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:31.880
why not put the ear in the box

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.980
along with it?

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.380
This case is just...

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.120
strange.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.310
Right?

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:37.940
Besides, who would dispose of a body

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.020
in broad daylight

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.270
so brazenly?

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.400
If you ask me,

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.790
body disposal should be done at night,

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:43.940
deep in the mountains.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.110
Just like right now.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:46.640
Also,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.330
that security guard's eyesight

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.260
is really poor.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.460
A frontal attack—

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.960
yet he didn't see the person.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.830
Half his face

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:53.140
was beaten bloody.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.280
He'll probably be disfigured.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.440
Which side was it?

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.370
Left... Left side.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.520
What's wrong?

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:03.940
Let's go!

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.370
What's wrong, Mentor?

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.570
Arrest Ni Xiangdong!

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.090
Where is he?

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.220
Inside.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.330

But Wu Ximei recited it directly.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:42.429
[The license plate number
Answer: Qin K77651]

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.719
She claimed they weren't close.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.630
So what does that mean?

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.290
Two things.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.280
First,

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.300
she knows him very well.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.300
Second, she rehearsed her answers.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.550
But she couldn't remember
his phone number.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.500
License plate numbers are short.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.230
Phone numbers are much longer.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:01.570
That neighbor who saw Ni Xiangdong
carrying a box out of her house—

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.030
which unit does he live in?

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.120
What's his name?

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.520
Unit 313, Li Qingfu.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.070
Go to him first thing tomorrow.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:10.460
Okay.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.530
Where are you going?

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.160
They've been...

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:35.610
looking for you...

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.920
all day.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.070
Come, have a drink.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.150
We're the criminal police.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.680
Hello.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.410
The deceased, Li Qingfu,

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.110
suffered a severe blow to the head.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:17.680
He died

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.360
roughly 1 to 3 hours ago.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.300
Notify the team to send more officers

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.360
and set up a cordon.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.030
Was he silenced, Mentor?

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.070
Within less than a day,

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.420
this place has actually seen

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.700
2 violent incidents.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.500
Notify the trace evidence team.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.100
Yes.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.030
For this kind of grease stain,

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.480
a dry cloth won't work.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.510
Try a washcloth

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.030
dampened with water.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.230
It'll wipe right off.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:21.510
Okay.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.890
Li Qingfu died downstairs.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.170
Did you know?

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.070
I saw it.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.450
Was he close to Cao Xiaojun?

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.440
Not really close,

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:46.550
just acquainted.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.330
They might have met a few times

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.560
when buying alcohol.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.400
Xiaojun likes to drink,

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.290
so they probably

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.760
met at a beer house.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.000
I heard Xiaojun say before

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.860
that he behaved badly when drunk.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:05.230
Was he close to Ni Xiangdong?

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.000
I don't know.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.690
Doesn't Ni Xiangdong come here often?

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.030
Could they have met?

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.110
He doesn't come that often.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.110
I don't know.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.320
Do you know how he died?

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:29.840
Is this related to Xiaojun?

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.080
Maybe not.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.000
Maybe yes.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:44.510
We found it.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:47.920
Xiaojun?

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:49.510
The box.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.890
Cao Xiaojun wasn't in the box.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.740
Then where is Xiaojun?

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.960
We've sent people to investigate.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.030
If you have

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.860
any useful information,

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.060
contact us promptly.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.400
Officers,

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.520
if he's never found,

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.280
is he considered dead or alive?

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.860
Do you want him to be dead or alive?

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.110
He's my husband.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.360
If possible,

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.260
I'd rather never find him.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:34.640
What do you mean?

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.840
I want Xiaojun to be safe.

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:43.920
But it's been a day and night

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.710
with no news.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:46.410
I'm scared too.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:56.880
As long as his body is not found,

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.970
I can still hold onto hope.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.770
When will Dad

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.760
come back?

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.370
Didn't I tell you

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.800
not to come out?

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.000
Why?

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:10.850
I want to ask

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.540
what exactly happened to Dad.

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.030
I said no, and that's final.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.560
Do you want to make me angry?

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:18.850
Tianbao, you're the best boy.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:19.590
Be good.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:21.930
Good boy.

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.160
Good boy.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.040
Don't cry.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:43.720
Is everything okay?

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.580
Do you need anything else, officers?

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.230
I've told you everything I know.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.760
I still need

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.890
to take Tianbao for a follow-up later.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.480
So clean.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.230
Even the table legs have been wiped.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:17.250
Last night,

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.320
I accidentally spilled some water,

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.050
so I cleaned up while I was at it.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:21.480
With something this serious,

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.540
don't you have any family to help you?

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.210
I don't have any other family.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.820
You don't have any contact

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.620
with your parents or relatives?

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.190
No.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.330
There must be someone who cares about you.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.760
I don't need that.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.630
I don't need anyone's concern.
