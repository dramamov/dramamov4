00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.800
I'm

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.150
the security guard
on duty at Mount Fufeng.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.360
I'm now in

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.240
an abandoned shed on the northern

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.440

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.710

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.120
a box here.

Did that security guard see you?

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.540
I knocked him out as soon as he came in.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.720
Then I stuffed him

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.750
into the box.

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.240
He called the police.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.840
I was panicking at that time.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.159
So I left the mountain

He asked me so many questions.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.630

what happened downstairs has spread.

But he's still alive.

Don't worry.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.810
I have a pretty good idea
where he might go.

Once we find him and kill him,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.320
we still have a chance
to get the compensation.

Mang Village?

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.400
My

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.850
household registration is there.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.640
But I moved to the city long ago.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.440
The surname Ni is quite rare,

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.140
but in Mang Village,

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.880
it's actually a common surname.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.310
Yes.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.960
Ni Xiangdong.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:28.760
Ye, Xiang, Rong, Yong, and Chuan.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:30.110
So your father

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.970
should be from the Ye generation.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.030
My father is called

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.130
Ni Caizeng.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.090
The Cai generation.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.090
The Cai generation?

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.080
There's no Cai generation.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.920
How is that possible?

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.640
You seem to know a lot

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.660
about our Ni clan.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.640
I used to have a friend

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.720
who, according to generational order,

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.400
should call you Uncle.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.920
However,

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.480
he's much older than you.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.310
Are you the only child in your family?

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.830
Do you have any siblings?

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.070
No,

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.040
just me.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.650
Why?

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.430
Nothing. Just chatting.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.440
Running into someone
from Nanyang in Weihai

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.400
is not easy.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.850
What's more, we're both from Jialin.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.000
Yeah.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.350
It's fate.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.750
It is.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.150
We have plenty of time ahead.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.100
That's right.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.840
We have plenty of time ahead.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.920
Hello?

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.350
Fried pancakes.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.270
Okay.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.560
Something up?

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.480
Please tell Wang Cheng

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.360
that I have an emergency at home.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.330
You're leaving?

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:28.730
I remember

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.530
you don't eat spicy food, right?

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.960
These two are for you.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.490
He grilled the wrong order.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:34.300
Go ahead.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:34.750
I didn't order...

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:35.960
We made extra. It's free.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.690
Just take it.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.510
Thanks.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:44.220
Alright.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:44.590
I'll raise five.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:45.520
I'll raise five.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.160
I'll call.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.160
Hurry up!

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:47.840
Finished.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.400
Out.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:49.440
Pass.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.610
I'll match five.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.050
Five, right?

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:54.400
Still calling?

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.030
Ten.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:56.610
Show the cards.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.980
Cao Xiaojun.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.440
My turn.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.580
Come play a few rounds.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.840
Help me change my luck.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.070
No money.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:04.750
That's no fun.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:05.680
Every time I ask you to play,

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.550
you're broke.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.110
If you don't play,

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.840
how will you know if you can win?

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.680
Go ahead and play.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.480
You guys play.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:13.590
Hey, guy on the top bunk,

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.160
come down and play
Three-Card Brag.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:15.690
This game

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.880
is only fun with more people.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.480
Come play.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.760
I don't know how.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.350
I'm asking nicely

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.480
for both of you to join us.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.240
One doesn't know how.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.500
The other has no money.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.610
What's that about?

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.210
Too good for me?

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.500
Too cool to join us?

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:28.590
Not true.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:30.440
I really don't know how.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.680
Fine.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.720
Go get us

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:35.650
some beer then.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.030
Draft beer,

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.070
not bottled.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:40.920
Who won?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.550
Me.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:49.640
Are you deaf?

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.270
I'm talking to you.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.310
Go buy some beer.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.070
You asking for trouble?

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.730
Stop, stop.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.790
Cheng. Cheng.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.070
Don't stoop to his level.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.870
Ni Xiangdong,

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.750
let's go.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.280
I'll go with you.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:07.310
That bastard Wang Cheng

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.910
just likes causing trouble.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.720
He lost at cards yesterday,

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.650
now he's taking it out on everyone.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:14.310
Try to avoid him.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.440
Today it's beer,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.200
next time it'll be cigarettes

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:18.880
or meat.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:21.350
What can we do?

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160
Nothing we can do.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.140
Just avoid him when possible.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.750
He's just a bully

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.690
because his uncle is the foreman.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.440
On his own merit,

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.790
he's nothing.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.480
My taking leave today

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.240
will just give him
another excuse to harass me.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.440
This morning,

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:51.570
I noticed

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.270
you seemed troubled.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.480
My son is sick.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:01.630
Is it serious?

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.450
Do you need much more money?

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.790
Far from enough.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.820
It's good if we can
just stabilize his condition.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.170
Why not borrow from friends first?

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200
Borrow from whom?

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.480
Everyone here does manual labor.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.550
Who has spare cash?

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.330
I'm a stranger in Weihai,

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.640
with no connections.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.200
Enough, let's not talk about it.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.610
It's not something that can be fixed

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:40.610
in just a few days.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.920
Winter is coming soon,

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.050
just one more month.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.830
Before the work stops,

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.430
I should earn whatever I can.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.020
What do you usually eat in your hometown?

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.680
Rice noodles.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.160
Have you ever tried

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.170
pork stewed with vermicelli?

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:08.090
No, I haven't.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.700
You've never had
pork stewed with vermicelli?

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.260
No.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.750
Come back to the Northeast
with me and try that.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:15.240
I'll treat you to
pork stewed with vermicelli

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.100
and pig-slaughter feast dishes.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:18.640
Sure.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.350
If I get a chance to visit Northeast.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.270
I still need

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.350
to work here.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.850
After the New Year,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.790
you probably won't even
get to eat fried pancakes anymore.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:32.510
This shop of mine

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.240
might close after the New Year.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.390
I'm quitting.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.000
Not coming back?

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.920
It's not profitable.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.270
Look, there's nobody even at mealtime.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.900
So I'm going back home.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.370
What will happen to it when you leave?

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.600
I'll take care of it for you.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.960
Okay.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.930
Just give it something to eat.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.410
It's not picky about food.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.480
We usually

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.480
just give it whatever,

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.340
and it eats everything just fine.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.390
Two threes.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.640
I only have two cards left.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.850
You're playing two threes, right?

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:10.550
So what?

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.270
Two tens.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:13.110
Cheng.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:15.240
I still want to ask

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.840
about our salary situation.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.940
It's been delayed for two months now.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.720
When will I get

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:22.750
my money?

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.290
My wife has been nagging me

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.150
for days now.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.590
Yeah.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.750
We haven't even been
paid for our previous work.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:29.440
And now,

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.680
work has stopped again.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.880
It'll be over two months.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.070
The most important thing is,

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.240
once work resumes,

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.830
how will

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.030
we get paid

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.050
for all this time?

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.350
Everyone's waiting to get paid

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.240
so they can go home for New Year.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:40.790
Alright.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.940
Stop complaining.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.960
What good does telling me do?

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.350
They owe me money too.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.400
Just play your cards.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.400
Can you top this pair of tens?

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.130
Well, but...

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:52.550
Where were we? Two tens.
Can you top them or not?

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:53.270
Two Jacks.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.240
One card left.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.330
Only one card left?

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.500
Can't beat it. You win.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.220
What cards are left?

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.560
Cheng, you're not playing anymore?

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.110
I'm done.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.460
Wang Cheng.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.960
Why don't you go talk to

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.510
your uncle again

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.310
and ask him to make an exception?

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.150
My child really

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.550
needs money for urgent medical care.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.030
I can't delay it any longer.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.969
I just told you.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.060
Didn't you hear me?

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.590
What's the point of coming to me?

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:34.400
If you need money urgently,

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.730
just go to him directly.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.920
Three fours.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.280
Triple with a single.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:49.800
Pass.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.159
Three eights.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:16.920
What?

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.150
Thanks.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:21.710
No problem.

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:24.490
I don't spend much money usually.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.360
I've already sent money home.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.150
Take it.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:32.690
It's fine.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.690
The child's medical care is what matters.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.230
I'll write you an IOU.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.480
After the New Year when I have money...

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.880
We'll talk about it then.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.510
Thank you, really.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:50.990
Hurry to the hospital.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.720
I'll take you to the station.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:05.770
Wang Cheng.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.440
Where did you

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.500
get all this money?

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:08.070
The meat...

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:08.590
Come with me.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.720
It's cheap and good.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.130
Meat.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:11.190
I just love eating meat.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.880
It's been so long since I had meat.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.590
I'm getting hungry.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:14.230
That place we ate at last time

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.160
was really good.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.070
Give me back my money.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:00.890
What money?

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.150
The money I kept inside my pillow.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.280
Who took your money?

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.440
-Give it back to me.
-What's wrong with you?

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.320
Who took your money?

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.190
-Didn't you take it?
-They're lottery tickets.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.630
-Who took your money?
-What's in your pocket?

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.280
-Get your hands off me.
-How could you afford lottery tickets?

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:11.840
Stop it.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:12.550
Give it to me.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.880
You're drunk, aren't you?

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.280
Give me the money.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.810
Get off! What are you doing?

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.100
You want to fight?

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.280
Are you drunk?

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.920
If you damage my lottery tickets,

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.740
I'll kill you.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.320
Give it to me.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.370
What are you all doing?

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.460
What are you doing?

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.330
Move aside.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.960
Uncle.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.850
He's crazy.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.530
He took my money.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:35.670
Let me tell you.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.400
New Year is coming soon.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.920
If either of you

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.980
causes me trouble,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.920
I'll see to it he hasn't a penny

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.760
to his name come Chinese New Year,

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.510
and I'll have him thrown out.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.510
Uncle, make him leave.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:43.440
Make him go away.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:44.550
He stole my money.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.280
You're causing trouble, huh?

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.000
If you don't want to work, get lost.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.320
You,

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.120
get lost!

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:50.030
Go!

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.800
Yellow, are you comforting me?

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.770
You know I'm upset.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:28.670
You're the best.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.190
So warm-hearted.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.250
Are you hungry?

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:51.880
Wait a moment.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.070
I'll go buy you something delicious.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:53.760
Okay?

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.550
Okay.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.040
I'll go get it for you.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.320
Wait for me.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.640
It's boiling.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.550
Come, pour me some.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.150
Have some.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.350
This soup is so fresh.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.880
Yellow.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.470
Yellow, come out.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:37.840
Yellow, where are you?

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.360
I bought you meat buns.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.480
Come out and eat.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.960
Smells good.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.330
Cover it.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:54.210
Wait a bit.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.190
Cover it up.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.740
Let it simmer a bit longer.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.140
Simmer it more.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.000
A bit longer.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.040
Put it down.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.550
It's so cold today.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:14.770
Got to eat something.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.340
What's cooking in the pot?

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.820
What do you mean what?

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:17.420
What is it?

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.640
I'm asking you.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.440
Are you crazy?

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.370
Where's Yellow?

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.000
Who's Yellow?

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.630
How would I know?

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.630
My dog.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.920
It's your dog.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.190
Why are you coming to me?

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.510
What's cooking in that pot?

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.920
Well.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.190
Once it's all stewed,
it all tastes the same.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.650
What do I care what's in it?

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.110
You kicked my pot!

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.590
Stop fighting!

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:43.280
Hit him!

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.110
Get him!

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.910
Hit him, Cheng!

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.920
Cheng!

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:49.400
Cheng!

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.760
Look.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.110
Is this Yellow?

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.650
Try it.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.800
Taste it.

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.800
Is it Yellow?

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.400
Try some.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:41:59.190
You bit me!

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.000
Let go!

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:00.530
Release him!

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:01.180
Let go!

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:03.120
Release!

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.400
Let go!

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:05.320
You bit me?

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:06.980
Beat him up!

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.170
Kill him...

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.080
What are you doing?

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:12.540
That's enough.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.440
Let go.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.440
This has nothing to do with you.

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:17.110
If you don't back off,

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.570
both of you get out of here!

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:22.020
I'll kill you.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.070
I'll finish you.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.590
I'll kill you.
