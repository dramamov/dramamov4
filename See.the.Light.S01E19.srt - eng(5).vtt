WEBVTT

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.560
She left

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.240
suddenly becomes empty.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.320
I finally feel at home.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.040
I suddenly...

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.880
Am I the problem?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.440
Why do I feel that people around me

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.280
for long.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.440
They always leave for various reasons.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.000
Jin-kyung, anyone

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.520
leave you at any time.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.520
Maybe they have their reasons.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.640
Maybe they were forced by the situation.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.680
but we just need to cherish

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.360
our time together

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.360
together.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.280
This will be the best memory

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.479
in our life.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.960
And if it's fate,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.880
we will meet again.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.600
You mean Yan, right?

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.160
Yan, Chu Lang, Hu Li.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.160
Everyone will.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.160
For Yan,

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.160
all these years has been resolved.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.160
I feel relieved too.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.560
Maybe she will be happier

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.200
Maybe she'll be happier.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.720
Shenhong Pawn Shop

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.560
Pack the package.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.920
Boss, is this your package?

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.440
During this time,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.400
all my information network

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.040
all my information network.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.520
Even if we can get in touch,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.960
they won't cooperate anymore.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.760
What do you mean?

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.960
Is it possible

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.040
we've been targeted?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.400
Information Network is my hard work these years.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.000
You know how much I invested.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.079
From south to north

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:20.920
are all my brothers

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.079
with me.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.280
refused our cooperation.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.520
This means

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.680
what they control and invest

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.920
is not just money.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.640
There might be other leverage.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.520
Someone caught him.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.120
That means they have taken action.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.480
Don't worry.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.360
It's not the time yet.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.480
We'll leave if it doesn't work.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.240
But...

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.640
But we've been planning for so long.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.360
We can't risk your lives.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.840
None of you can make any mistake.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.520
You, Jinjing, Wang Yu,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.240
or even Zhou Mu.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.880
Mr. Si.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.440
No one can make any mistake.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.480
is my bottom line.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.320
Captain Zhou.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.360
Why are you here?

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.320
I have something to ask you.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.200
What do you want to ask?

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.400
You can ask me first.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.520
The man we caught for you in the foreign car case.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.280
You know about Zou Shixuan's case.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.520
Now you're here.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.279
Is Captain Zhou incompetent

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.880
or ask us for help?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.720
You...

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.560
Mr. Si, if I want,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.840
I can treat you

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.360
to the police station for tea.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.360
Will you?

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.440
Have some tea.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.240
Take me away.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.760
Shut up!

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.800
Let's talk outside.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.120
Is your butt clean?

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.880
Mind your own business first.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.880
Why are you still hanging out with them?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.480
To me,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.600
they are my family.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.680
What's wrong with being with my family?

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.680
Family?

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760
Do you know

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.920
they are doing something very dangerous?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.760
Really?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.200
Without them,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.560
can we solve the foreign car case?

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.440
Without them,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.080
the human traffickers wouldn't have been eliminated.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.840
Without them,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.720
we don't know how many girls

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.120
will be destroyed by Zou Shixuan.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.760
You know very well

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.640
they have been doing

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.680
doing the right and dangerous things.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.480
You just don't want to admit it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.120
I finally know

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.320
why this world is like this.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.320
You're so pretty. Just follow me.

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.760
Kid, we'll take care of her for you.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.640
Zou Tingting found a mistress from a big family.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.480
Really?

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.200
Yeah.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.520
How about a drink with me?

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.320
I have plenty of money.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.040
You're so generous.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.760
Have you ever thought

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.960
the law

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.720
has seriously let the victim down.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.240
The existence of Shenhong Pawn Shop is meaningful

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.760
When one day

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.760
the criminals will be punished.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.680
You don't have to tell me.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.080
we will disappear.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.920
We are all working hard

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.120
for the same thing.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.920
It's just a different way.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.520
What I said just now

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.440
mean anything else.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.360
It's just that

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.600
I think we are the same kind of people.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.240
So I don't want you to look at my friends

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.520
to see my friends.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.680
Move aside

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.840
What are you doing

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.680
Move.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.680
What are you doing?

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.520
You're not allowed in here.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.880
You can't go in.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.800
Let me in! Stop!

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.400
Boss!

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.920
Let her in.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.800
Excuse me.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.320
Boss.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.720
Biryeom.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.640
Wang Yu.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.240
Boss.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.159
What's going on?

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.600
For now,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.560
it should be a large-scale fight.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.560
Basically blunt weapons.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.000
There's no trace of a gun.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.120
But...

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.640
But what?

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.600
But I didn't find them either.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.640
Impossible.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.160
They must have escaped.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.320
They could have been arrested.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.600
No way.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.800
Absolutely impossible.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.120
You know Scarlett.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.640
She's amazing.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.520
She can escape.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.560
Calm down.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.320
Wait.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.040
Tell the Violent Crimes Unit

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.240
to send more people to check the main roads.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.040
Arrest anyone suspicious.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.120
Yes.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.000
And don't let my father know.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:28.920
Yes.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.400
Go.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.080
[Jin-kyung.]

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.000
You're right.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.919
Judging from their skills,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.559
they must have escaped.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.520
Even if they are caught,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.720
I'll ask all my men to investigate.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.320
to ensure their safety.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.040
Think about it now.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.440
If you were Scarlett,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.760
what would you do in this situation?

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.440
Don't worry.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.280
No matter what,

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.120
I'm still by your side.
