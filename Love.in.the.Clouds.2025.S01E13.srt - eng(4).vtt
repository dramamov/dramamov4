that Yaoguang Mountain's Ming Xian

We've been searching everywhere in Jixing Abyss

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.670
and caught Ming Xian's companion beast.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.470
He was very sly

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.120

with how weak he is,

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.310
he only escaped from Dragon Carp Terrace

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.640
because Lord Hanfeng willed it so.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.040
Lord Hanfeng wanted to see

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.880
where he was hiding in Jixing Abyss.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.360
Do you think it's a coincidence

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.070
that the companion beast ran back to Wugui Sea?

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.120
Granny Xun, take a look.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:09.950
This is

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.310
the Search Mirror that will react to Ming Xian.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.160
Granny Xun,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.070
why does the Search Mirror

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.280
point to Fairy Ming Yi directly?

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.040
Does it mean

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.360
Fairy Ming Yi

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.040
is actually Yaoguang Mountain's Ming Xian in disguise?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.670
This is impossible.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.240
This is never-ending.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.640

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.360
and useless tasks

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.830
that are just for show in Judgment Hall?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.920
I won't have time to find the medicine.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.670

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.400

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.360
Please get a few guards on duty

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.670
to help me

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.640
mark these documents as read.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.190
I know everyone is busy,

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.360
but it's different for guards on duty.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.760
Even if they're on duty, they are just standing there.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.790
Come inside, have some tea,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:35.790
and take a break

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.760
while helping me out.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.120
But

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.830
there's no one else in Judgment Hall.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.400
No way.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.920
They are better at slacking off than I am.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.920
Not at all.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.190
Actually, all of them are very responsible.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.520
However, Ji Bozai was harboring Ming Xian

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.310
so Lord Hanfeng took them away

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.920
to capture Ming Xian at Wugui Sea.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.120
Ji Bozai is harboring Ming Xian?

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.880
When did that happen?

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.670
Ming Yi, what's going on?

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.160
How surprising.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.120
Immortal Ji

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.040
married Fairy Ming Yi not long ago.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.550
Right now,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.400
not only did Ming Xian's companion beast

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.790
escape to Wugui Sea,

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.520
but the Search Mirror points at you too.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.070
I'm sure you're upset.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.070
He's your companion beast after all.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.310
Unfortunately,

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.550
the proof is irrefutable.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.470
I have no choice but to believe

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.360
that our proud warrior, Ji Bozai,

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.000
is colluding with Yaoguang Mountain

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.710
to harbor the enemy of Jixing Abyss, Ming Xian.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.040
Sun Liao,

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.040
capture them.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.470
Try me.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.590
The contraption and the key are here.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.790
This is the full layout of Zhuojin Tower.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.470
In every Qingyun Tournament,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.120
there will be a Gudiao beast in the arena.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.790
Many warriors died to it.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.120
This is...

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.360
A way to defeat the Gudiao beast?

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.120
Get all of them to learn it.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.670
I'm sure it's possible even for a fool.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.880
Your Highness.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.790
What are you doing?

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.040
We are here on Lord Hanfeng's order

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.520
to capture the criminal, Ji Bozai.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.470
Coming at me again?

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.280
What is Lord Hanfeng accusing me of this time?

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.520
Lord Hanfeng has found

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.240
that Ji Bozai is harboring

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.590
Ming Xian of Yaoguang Mountain at Wugui Sea

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.640
by disguising him as a woman

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.640
under the identity of Ming Yi.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.070
Ming Yi is Ming Xian?

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.280
When did Lord Hanfeng make this story up?

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.280
Even then,

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.640
do you believe in that story?

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.310
Have all of you gone senile?

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.880
How could you

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.240
say something so absurd?

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.400
Everyone in the Six Realms

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.550
knows that Ming Xian's companion beast is a white cat.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.920
That cat

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.880
was captured in Wugui Sea.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.470
Moreover, Lord Hanfeng

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.520
has a Search Mirror

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.950
that only reacts to Ming Xian.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.880
- Search Mirror? - Take a guess

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.240
on who the Search Mirror

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.040
pointed to?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.470
This fairy is suspicious.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.520
She triggered a reaction from our Search Mirror.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:41.880
Please move.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.280
Lord Hanfeng will take Ming Yi away for questioning.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:46.830
Once she confesses,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.550
we'll know

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.880
if you ever harbored Ming Xian.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.760
However, the current situation

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.830
indicates that you are an accomplice.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.550
You cannot stay in Shouhua Academy

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.590
and be the exemplar for warriors.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.790
Immortal Ji, please cooperate.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.880
Everyone,

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.000
Ming Xian and his companion beast are resisting capture.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.470
I have no choice but to kill them all.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.550
As for Ji Bozai,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.070
we have irrefutable proof

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.120
of his collusion with the enemy.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.640
His identity as a warrior will be stripped

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.280
and be demoted to a criminal.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.360
Ming Yi

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.280
is just a weak fairy.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.920
It is easy for you

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.040
to get a confession out of her through torture.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.670
All of you are just trying

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.120
to slander Ji Bozai.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.120
Lord Hanfeng, you are trying to slander His Lordship.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.880
But you have to go through me first.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.920
Granny Xun, do you

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.760
have a death wish

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.590
and hope Ji Bozai will join you in the underworld later?

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.160
Your loyalty

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.880
moves me.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.470
In that case, I will grant your wish.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:45.880
Where is he?

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:48.790
Wugui Sea.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.790
Ji Bozai.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.790
I sent my men to bring you in for questioning.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.070
Did you resist

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.400
and escape?

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.950
In that case, my allegation of your collusion

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.760
and treason isn't a false accusation.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.830
I have no time to talk to you.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.230
Wait.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.950
Uncle.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.600
What's going on?

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.920
Ming Yi is obviously a normal fairy.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.840
How can she be Ming Xian?

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.400
It's just nice that the people of Shouhua Academy

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.230
are here.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.320
I will

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.800
make things clear right here.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.510
Today, a young man trespassed into the Sunken Abyss

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:36.840
and was captured alive by Sun Liao.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.600
He is over there.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:41.600
Do all of you know

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.640
that he is a companion beast?

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.710
- A companion beast? - Companion beast?

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.360
He's indeed a white cat.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.190
He's a white cat.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.590
- Why is this companion beast in Ming Yi's arms? - Yes.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.230
Why is Ming Xian's companion beast in Wugui Sea?

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.820
Right.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.360
- Ming Xian's companion beast. - Does it mean...

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.800
I'm sure all of you know clearly

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.510
what the companion beast of Ming Xian is.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.950
Within the Six Realms,

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.270
the only one who has a white cat companion beast

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.160
that can turn into a human

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.600
is Ming Xian.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.120
This is indeed Ming Xian's companion beast.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.750
How come his companion beast

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.600
appears in Jixing Abyss?

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:14.950
Ji Bozai,

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.640
I told Sun Liao

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.640
to deliberately let this companion beast go.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.560
He saw it run back to Wugui Sea immediately.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.640
Your new wife is even more interesting.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.360
She's hugging Ming Xian's companion beast tightly.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.080
Sun Liao.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.750
You are a joke!

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.230
You were a warrior in the last Qingyun Tournament.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.880
However, Ji Bozai defeated you easily

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.950
so you had a grudge against him.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.710
That was why you spread false information to my uncle.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.670
I...

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.990
Uncle,

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.920
I think there's a misunderstanding.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.510
Ji Bozai has nothing to do with Ming Xian.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.920
In my opinion,

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.640
this companion beast must have escaped to Wugui Sea by accident

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.470
when it was in a panic.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.120
Sun Liao wanted to use this

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.120
to frame Ming Yi, a fairy, as Ming Xian?

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.950
How ridiculous.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.800
Besides, you don't care about Ming Yi at all.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.750
You only want to incriminate Immortal Ji.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.950
Your Highness, I...

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.080
Uncle, what do you think?

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.840
It fled in a panic

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.320
and it chose Wugui Sea?

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.080
This is too much of a coincidence.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.750
Besides, how do you explain this?

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.880
This is an artifact made by Ming Xian,

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.840
the Search Mirror.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.470
If Ming Xian appears nearby,

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.230
the mirror will react

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:47.950
and point to his position.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.600
It does point at her.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.190
Yes.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.710
She really is Ming Xian.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.880
This is impossible.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.560
But she's a girl.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.190
That's right.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.230
Ji Bozai's new wife

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.670
is not a fairy at Moonlit Blossoms at all.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.360
Perhaps Ji Bozai

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.950
learned some evil spell from somewhere

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.120
and turned Ming Xian into a girl

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.270
to hide his identity so he could be by his side.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.160
Ji Bozai,

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.920
this is irrefutable proof of your collusion with the enemy.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.470
Surrender now.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:31.640
Lord Hanfeng,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.670
you went through all the hassle

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.560
just to incriminate yourself?

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.840
Ji Bozai,

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.470
have you gone mad?

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.560
You dare manipulate the Search Mirror

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.560
in front of everyone?

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.120
Yes. I did it.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.920
Since the Search Mirror can be manipulated so easily,

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.160
it means you can also manipulate it.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.600
Besides, it's just a stupid mirror.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.920
Can it really point to Ming Xian

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.990
because you said so?

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.750
You're trying to slander me

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.560
by using such a broken artifact?

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.920
Lord Hanfeng,

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.030
I think you are the one who has gone mad.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.670
This mirror was made by Ming Xian indeed.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:35.950
When Ming Xian was 16,

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.840
he made this artifact

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.560
after winning the Qingyun Tournament for the fourth time.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.120
If a criminal escapes,

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.120
this mirror can connect with that person's

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.030
belongings

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.400
and pinpoint the criminal.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.120
That is how it gained the name, Search Mirror.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.160
The criminal, Hou Zhao, was the one

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.640
who offered it as tribute to Yaoguang Mountain.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.670
Lord Chengyun of Yaoguang Mountain, Ming Xin,

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.710
used this mirror to make fun of Jixing Abyss,

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.950
saying they loved crafting artifacts

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.880
yet they couldn't even make

00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.800
a decent artifact for locating criminals.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.160
Hou Zhao was angry

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.560
and recorded this with the Recording Mirror.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.270
I've seen the Search Mirror through the Recording Mirror.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.920
It is indeed this mirror before us.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.080
Hou Zhao did commit a grave crime

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.880
but he did one good thing after all.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.400
Otherwise,

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.400
Lord Hanfeng would've been wrongly accused.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.640
Ji Bozai,

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.600
do you have anything else to say?

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.600
However, I don't understand one thing.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.160
The Search Mirror has always been kept in the Yaoguang Palace.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.710
How did you get it, Lord Hanfeng?

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.230
You accused Ji Bozai of collusion

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.230
but you, the one who has the Search Mirror of Yaoguang Mountain,

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.750
are even more suspicious.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.710
Situ Ling.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.950
Why are you questioning me instead?

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.600
As expected.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.600
Ming Xian created this for fun when he was young.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.320
Even someone like me, who has no spiritual veins,

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.030
can control this mirror

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.230
and manipulate it as I wish.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.600
This is too easy.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.360
Immortal Situ.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.360
What are you doing?

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.800
To uncover the truth, obviously.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.470
Today,

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.360
you redeployed all my guards at Judgment Hall

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.710
without my approval.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.750
How odd.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.230
Judgment Hall ought to investigate cases independently,

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.190
yet you can order my men

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.400
as you wish.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.120
With your support,

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.030
they even captured

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.230
the only warrior who defeated Ming Xian in the past seven years.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.470
My title as the chief

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.750
feels toothless.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.320
How interesting.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.470
Out of nowhere,

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:43.360
you accused a girl

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.160
of being the Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.710
and even framed me for harboring Ming Xian.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.230
All right. I'll admit it.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.990
Ming Xian begged me to collude with him

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.190
and wanted to serve me

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.750
so that Yaoguang Mountain would lose its Blessed Rain.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.880
He even turned into a girl to marry me.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.470
This is such an elaborate ruse.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.120
Right?

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.950
Uncle, please tell us

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.600
who gave you

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.400
the Search Mirror.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.840
That person

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.950
must be the mastermind

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.750
who colluded with Yaoguang Mountain.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:25.120
Uncle, you must not be tricked by evil people.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.800
Worry not.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.920
No traitors or suspicious people

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.120
can get away under my nose.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.120
However, isn't our priority now

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.800
to confirm

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.190
Fairy Ming Yi's identity?

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.750
Perhaps Ming Xian used some evil spells to transform himself.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.990
Besides, it's also strange that Fairy Ming Yi insists on

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.990
protecting this young man.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.190
I must take her back for questioning.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.640
Sure.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.990
Twenty-Seven.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.510
Ji Bozai, what are you doing?

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.950
After I defeated Ming Xian that day,

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.080
I took his companion beast as a trophy.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.670
The owner of this white cat now

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.920
is me.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.230
That was why he returned to Wugui Sea after he was seriously injured.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.560
Lord Hanfeng,

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:44.470
you falsely accused my wife

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.600
of being the Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.950
without any evidence.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.360
If I also let you take my pet away,

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:51.990
I will no longer

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.470
have a place in Jixing Abyss in the future.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.600
What a joke.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.950
I've never seen you capture Ming Xian's companion beast

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.510
at the Qingyun Tournament.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.190
You're now trying to protect a companion beast.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.600
Ji Bozai,

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.800
how dare you call yourself innocent?

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.400
Ji Bozai came from the Sunken Abyss.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.400
Before I use him,

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.560
I've checked his background.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.990
Uncle, if you don't believe him,

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.270
I can vouch for his innocence.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.320
If you find Ming Yi and the companion beast suspicious,

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:33.840
you may capture them.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.470
Why must you

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.080
slander the person I chose?

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:41.510
Fine.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.400
I have ways

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.470
to make her speak

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.510
and find out who she really is anyway.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.950
Ming Yi is my wife.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.510
I know who she is

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.560
more than anyone else.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.320
If you harm her today,

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.360
I won't let you live to see tomorrow.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.230
Since she is your wife, Immortal Ji,

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.080
I still have another way

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.640
to verify her true identity.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.950
Marriage Stone.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.840
Marriage Stone?

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.470
That is a good way indeed.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.230
The Marriage Stone is an ancient stone.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.320
It can be used to verify one's true identity.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.230
Every soul has a name.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.080
The name must match the body

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.120
before the name can be carved on the stone.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.470
Ji Bozai is a warrior.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.640
He is not supposed to form a heart imprint

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.670
and share divine consciousness.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.190
However, since Immortal Ji

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.270
trusts Fairy Ming Yi so much,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.270
I do think

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:04.710
that this method of verification

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.920
is worth a try.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.080
Fine.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.320
I will prove it to all of you.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.950
I will make up

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.990
for what I owe you previously.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.560
If the visitors are lovers,

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.710
the Love Bridge will be connected.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.120
Please get on the bridge.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.470
They passed through Mengyuan Pond's barrier.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.270
How is that possible?

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.270
Outsiders are not allowed in the Lovers' Domain.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.230
Stay back.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.640
Shao Qun.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.160
Uncle, you know very well

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.990
that this barrier is impenetrable to all

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.360
except for two people in love.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:47.840
I'm sure they've passed the Magpie Bridge Domain

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.400
and entered the depths of Mengyuan Pond.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.620
[Ji Bozai]

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.990
If

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.160
I am not Ming Yi,

what are the consequences?

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.950
The Lovers' Domain only accepts true love.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.600
If there is any deceit, divine punishment will follow.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.560
At best, the primordial spirit will be shattered.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.400
At worst, one will be reduced to ashes.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.470
Do you want to die?

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:18.840
Are you stopping me

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.160
because you're worried that I might kill you

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.920
after I know the truth?

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.560
No matter who you are,

everything has gone your way.

We are now on the same boat.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.230
If I cannot ascertain your identity,
