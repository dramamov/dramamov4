00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:01.679
What are you doing here?

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.840
(How did he find me?)

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.200
Why are you here?

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.200
Weren't you that client

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.280
at the club?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You got the wrong person.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.560
No way I'm mistaken.

00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:13.711
I looked after you all night.

00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:14.840
How could I be wrong?

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.760
Oh! Gold digger Tang Baozhu!

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.120
(He thinks I'm Baozhu.)

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:21.799
I must've been blind!

00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:23.230
(Better get rid of him first.)

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.879
Let's add each other.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.959
Ms. Baozhu.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:33.040
Add me.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.200
Seriously? They came for me?

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.640
Those two were only
trying to ruin your wedding.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.480
I already sent them away.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.200
And how did you do that?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.079
Tell me.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.480
What do you even see
in that old man, Lu Jianhua?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.069
The fact that he is old?

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.155
That his health is failing?

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.040
Look at us young guys.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.200
We're strong and good-tempered.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.519
(Gu Liusu)
(50,000 yuan received on WeChat)

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:57.319
I've been too busy
to return your clothes.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.359
I know your job is not easy either.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.560
But you?

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.599
You're only worth this much.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200
Gentlemen.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.840
Step aside.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.159
And you.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.680
Do you really think
you're worthy of Tang Baozhu?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.599
I...

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.479
What does that mean?

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.960
Why do I feel

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.159
like something doesn't add up?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.439
Baozhu.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:29.719
Hello.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:30.360
Hi, Baozhu.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.960
Welcome.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.439
What game is this gold digger playing?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.840
We'll talk later.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.599
Hi, beauty, are you here alone?

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.319
Why are you two still here?

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.800
Not satisfied with the tips
and money for clothes?

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.560
You're young,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.719
and you don't look bad.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.560
Why spend your time
scheming for easy money?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.199
What do you take me for?

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.719
You think I'm a male host?

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.240
Aren't you?

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.280
So that 50,000 yuan was

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.360
actually hush money.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.560
You're a repeat offender!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I get it now.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.919
You're trying to blackmail me.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.000
It's just your luck to run into me.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:11.879
I was drunk and out of it that night.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.120
Who knows what you did?

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.560
As for the rest,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.759
go explain it to the police.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.759
I...

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.120
Xingchen.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.759
So long.

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.199
Xingchen is here.

00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:21.190
She is the gold digger you're marrying?

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.879
What?

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.039
You two know each other?

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.120
We don't.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.240
Hi, Xingchen.

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.199
Lu talks about you all the time.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.039
Xingchen.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.199
Let me introduce you.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.560
Xingchen?

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.840
(Lu Xingchen?)

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.759
(Tang Baozhu's stepson?)

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.080
This is

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.360
Ms. Baozhu,
the one I mentioned on the phone.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.439
(She is the gold digger.)

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.280
(So she is...)

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.560
- (This is so awkward.)
- (So awkward.)

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.639
And this is Ms. Baozhu's best friend.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.879
Aunt Liusu.

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.639
Can you even hear yourself?

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.479
Liusu is still young.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.879
Call her sister.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.479
We can't mess up the seniority.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.360
You two aren't married yet.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.560
Don't start bossing me.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.240
Xingchen.

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:11.879
Your Aunt Liusu

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.280
has a lot of experience

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.439
in running the company.

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.800
From now on,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.920
you should learn more from her.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.680
It's "sister".

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.360
(I'm done for.)

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.639
(I slept with my best friend's stepson.)

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:30.759
Mr. Lu.

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:32.639
The boss of Yuanyang Group is here.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.079
Baozhu.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:35.160
We'll greet them together.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:37.199
Take this chance

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.600
to learn from your Aunt Liusu.

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.879
How many times do I have to say it?

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.720
Call her "sister".

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.199
Don't mess up the family hierarchy.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.240
What do I do now?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.160
You two besties

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.399
are pretty interesting.

00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:00.430
One clings to a sugar daddy.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.560
The other finds a host...

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480
What are you doing?

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.319
Hey, what are you doing?

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.439
I want you to

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.000
completely forget that night.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.720
Just because you say so?

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.279
I deserve credit for my effort.

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:17.040
We're both adults.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.079
No need to spell everything out.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:20.199
But listen,

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.189
Baozhu and Lu Jianhua

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.866
have been together
for five or six years.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.199
She isn't a calculating person.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.680
I hope you won't misunderstand her.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.439
Not calculating?

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:31.160
She marries a man as old as her dad.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.399
What do you call that?

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.079
Is she not a gold digger? Seriously?

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.879
Put your hand down.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:38.680
I don't believe it.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:40.720
Old man, young wife.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.199
Why is the woman the gold digger?

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.399
Maybe the man is just lustful.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:44.480
If you have the guts,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.319
go blame your dad.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:46.720
Why make my bestie take the blame?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.480
I...

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.079
You what?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.439
You are twisted.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.720
Angry talk from someone powerless

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:58.399
and narrow-minded.

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:00.600
Your character is
worse than your skills.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.079
You're saying my skills

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:09.600
(are bad?)

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.020
(Four Days Ago)

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.820
(Successful Youth)

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.079
I heard your stepmom got your dad
completely wrapped around her finger.

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:29.800
Are they about to get engaged?

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.959
What?

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:32.279
I said,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.319
your stepmom got your dad
completely wrapped around her finger.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.040
Why do you always
bring up the worst topic?

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.160
I'm going to the restroom.

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.680
Isn't that the same lady from earlier?

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:00.199
She obviously can't hold her liquor.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.399
She doesn't look drunk though.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.720
Don't bother.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.200
I'll call security to take her out.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.199
No.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.800
This is Xinghan's club.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.920
If we tossed her out,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.399
it'd ruin our reputation.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.360
Get her to a lounge room.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.240
Take her away first.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.480
You want me to carry her?

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.439
She is a pretty one.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.680
Lucky she ran into us.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.480
She could've been in real danger.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.120
Danger? What danger?

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.279
So what do we do now?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.480
We're the ones in danger.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.120
I'm busy.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.759
You take care of her. I'm leaving.

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:45.560
Pal!

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.120
- I'm a germophobe!
- I'm out!

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.879
Who are you?

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:54.360
Lu.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.560
Xing.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.439
Chen!

00:07:58.319 --> 00:07:59.839
I don't care who you are.

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.079
I want to go home.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.120
Why are you touching me?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.480
Stay away from me.

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:12.240
Lady,

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:13.600
I didn't want to touch you.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.399
But you're stepping all over the place.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.040
Hanging upside down
cuts off my oxygen, you know.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:24.319
Stop wandering around.
I really can't stand the mess!

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.839
I want to go home.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.000
I want to go home.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.039
Take off your coat first.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:33.960
Wash your feet.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.919
Don't get me wrong.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.399
Customer first.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.600
I'll make sure

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.622
you're taken care of.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.555
There you go
hanging me upside down again.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.240
Let go.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.644
I'll wash your feet.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.240
I don't want to.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.039
No way!

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.120
- I said no!
- You have to.

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:53.480
I said no!

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.480
Thanks for cooperating.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.120
Not too hot, right?

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.720
I'll sue you for this.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.600
Just you wait.

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:10.080
This bar serves tainted drinks.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.679
I'll sue the bar, too.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:16.679
Fine.

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:17.960
Sue away.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.799
I'll wait for your lawyer's notice.

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:20.960
I'll find someone to help you.

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:21.679
A woman.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:22.759
A woman.

00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:24.559
I didn't touch you.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.519
I didn't touch you.

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:29.919
She thinks I'm a host.

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.320
She even gave me hush money.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.399
(Does she think she slept with me?)

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.200
What are you staring at?

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.140
(Female)

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.159
(Gu Liusu...)

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.360
(Interesting.)

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.399
(She even blacks out from drinking.)

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.879
(Let me take a look at
how ridiculous you were that night.)

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:06.720
(This is...)

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.740
(Trending! Utterly scandalous!)

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.300
(GL's new release is a design fail!
GL Jewelry, an aesthetic disaster.)

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.300
(It's 2023. How can they still come up
with such outdated styles?)

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.300
(This taste is
at least twenty years behind.)

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.300
(So overpriced, yet it looks so cheap.)

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.519
- Ms. Gu.
- Ms. Gu.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:22.279
Why is Starry Sea now trending?

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.029
I have people taking it down.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.690
We also pushed out that gossip
about the top Gen Z idol's love life.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.750
Now the top five
trending topics are all about him.

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:30.279
Our internal review has already started.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:31.840
Starry Sea has already been exposed.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.840
Should we think
about switching designs?

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.480
Switching?

00:10:36.488 --> 00:10:38.000
All the promotion from the first half

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.399
was built around the Starry Sea line.

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:40.840
And now you tell me to switch it out?

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:48.039
Sue the original Weibo poster
and every related public account.

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:49.159
All of them.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.480
As for the rest,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.639
give me a plan within half a day.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.639
- Yes, Ms. Gu.
- Yes, Ms. Gu.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.799
Time for a meeting.

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:06.240
Hello?

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.670
Ms. Gu. Someone is here to see you.

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:08.389
Who is it?

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.760
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hang on a sec.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.560
