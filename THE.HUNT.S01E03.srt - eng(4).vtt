00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.490
Give me your money to spend.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.840
Fine, it's all yours.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.030
Take it back.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.630
I never bully women.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.770
My name is Ni Xiangdong.
"Xiangdong" means "toward the east,"

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.480
echoing the verse "a river of spring
flows endlessly eastward."

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.790
If anyone bullies you around here,

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.990
just mention my name.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.240

Treat it.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.320
Girls shouldn't have scars.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.670
She bit me.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.440
Dong, where are we going tonight?

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.950
With this little money? Where can we go?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.900
Let's go to the video hall.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.200
What should we watch?

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.900
"Comrades: Almost a Love Story."

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.790
Last time you watched it,

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.010
didn't you fall asleep?

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:05.200
[Inherit Chinese culture
and promote the national spirit.]

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.550
Can't I watch it again?

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.200
Fine, fine, fine.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.000
What do you think of that girl just now?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
What do you think?

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:24.970
I think she's pretty good.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.340
If you think she's good, then she's good.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.100
I've never seen that girl before.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.620
Find out about her for me tomorrow, okay?

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.120
Didn't we agree

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.330
on 150 per month?

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.680
Why is it 100 less?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.660
We also work from dawn till dusk.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.030
We don't earn much from washing hair.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.560
Why are you cutting our pay?

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.330

Mr. Dao, please stop hitting.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.160
If her face is bruised, how can she work?

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.810
Get her out.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.440
Don't make a mess.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:39.930
I won't...

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:40.480
I won't go.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:40.840
Next.

What a shame.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.310
You chose the wrong profession.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.800
How long have you been here?

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.510
Over 6 months.

Pride or profit —

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.930
you can only choose one.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.440
Thank you, Mr. Dao.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.320
Next.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.140
Sir, get a haircut?

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.120
Wash, cut and blow-dry.

Wash first.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.970
What a coincidence.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.180
Do you remember me?

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:16.630
Well.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.080

Please wash my hair first.

There's another customer ahead of you.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.690
You'll be next after he's done.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:28.750

She's petite.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.560
And pretty too.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.310
She can massage the head.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.000
The back too.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.390
What else can she massage?

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.870
Sir, sir.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.270
It's okay.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.390
Pretty girl.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.670

Keep massaging.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:09.880
We can negotiate the price.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.589
Pretty girl, you've got quite a grip.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.440
It's fine. I can take it.

Okay.

Thank you.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.200
Don't get it wet.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.880
Okay.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
What's this?

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:39.920
Let's go.

Disinfect it.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.890
Or it might get infected.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.070
No need.

-It's OK.
-Let me help you first.

It might get worse.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.470
No need to bandage it.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.900
Such a small wound is nothing.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.440
I've had much worse injuries before.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.970
I didn't bandage it either.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:33.650
It will get infected.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.920
Washing it with seawater heals faster.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.960
Leave it. Let me help you.

Even though my bandaging isn't great,

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.550
it's still better
than what you guys can do.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.030
I really don't understand

how you guys fight every day

but don't even know how to dress a wound.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.080
Just making do is fine.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.110
It won't kill us.

What to do?

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.510
Just pay for the damages.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.020
I don't have money.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.510
I can't afford to pay.

I can't explain it to Mr. Dao.

Mr. Dao, my boss.

The one who took people back today.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.930
I have some impression of that Mr. Dao.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.530
Do you know his background?

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:27.550
Worst case,

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.280
you don't work for him anymore.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.070
If Mr. Dao doesn't approve,

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.030
I can't leave.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.680
I can't afford to cross him.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.550
Everything will work out in the end.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.350
We'll deal with whatever comes.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.040
At worst,

you can hang with us two.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.000
You two?

on Huayuan Street

eat and sit as I please.

Yes.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.520
is just a pimp.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.680
What's the big deal?

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.170
If you're uncomfortable talking to him,

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.430
I'll help you solve it.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.480
I'll go find that Mr. Dao tomorrow.

[May wealth and prosperity flow in]

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.720
Mr. Dao.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.400
I'm sorry.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.750
This time it's my fault.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.440
Just name your price.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.910
I'll try my best to get it.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.560
How much can you come up with?

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.280
Is this something money can solve?

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.400
Mr. Dao.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.060
You're straightforward too.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.530
So what do you suggest?

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.420
Are these two also from Baorong Village?

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.240
I just met them.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.730
She's under my protection.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.780
Talk to me if there's any problem.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.680
Who's backing you?

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.760
Which boss are you working for?

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.000
I work for Dong.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.160
Are you Dong?

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.110
Me.

Ni Xiangdong.

You think you're tough, huh?

Cheng.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.440
Let's be clear about this.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.750
This isn't about money.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.480
It's about face.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.480
Tell me.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.070
What should we do?

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.200
Two of those troublemakers

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.730
from the other day got away.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.320
I know where they are now.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.750
I'm leaving these two people

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.080
for you to handle, Dong.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.070
Fine.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.550
For my shop

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.550
to be renovated,

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.920
it'll cost about...

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:28.870
This much.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.200
That bigger guy,

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.350
one finger, 10,000 yuan.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.030
Okay.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.750
If I bring you

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:40.950
one more finger,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.680
does it count as an extra 10,000, right?

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.550
I want the 21st one.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:56.640
Don't worry.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.640
We'll handle it for you.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.920
Take the cigarettes.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.920
Come back.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.740
Close the door.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.880
Sit down.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.880
Everyone

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.000
calls me Mr. Dao.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.030
Do you know my full name?

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.160
Wu

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:33.880
Zheng

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:34.640
dao.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.480
Sounds like "no right path." Is
there any right path left in this world?

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.030
Is there?

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.070
Yes, there is.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.270
It just depends if your feet

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.640
will walk that path.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.200
I've always had high hopes for you.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.500
Make sure you master hair washing

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:54.590
and haircutting.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.880
After half a year,

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.240
I'll open a shop for you,

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.730
and you'll be the manager.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.680
If you really don't want to

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.480
work under me,

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.680
you can rent your own shop

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.550
and have a stable,

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:03.410
peaceful life.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.680
Isn't that good?

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.270
Wu Ximei.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.640
I'm asking you seriously.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.960
Do you want to continue

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.160
working here?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.640
What we fear

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.080
is not having no choice,

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.550
but choosing wrong.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.790
One wrong choice

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.760
brings a lifetime of hardship.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.550
Two options

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.480
are in front of you.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.510
How to choose?

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.240
Figure it out yourself.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.480
Mr. Dao.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.840
I'll stay and work here.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.350
Once the shop is fixed up,

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.800
I'll train two more

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.090
skilled hair washers.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.000
We're like family.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.920
Let's be honest.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.240
In the future,

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.400
do you still plan

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.690
to hang around with

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.180
those two troublemakers?

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.790
Let me be honest with you too.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.270
That boy with

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.160
the scar by his eye

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.350
won't last long.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.950
I'll take the stronger one

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.600
and you handle the other one.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.590
Once we're inside,

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:33.590
we'll improvise.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.880
You two!

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.790
Guys,

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:57.910
grab your weapons!

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:47.960
Are you guys

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.350
alright?

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.370
What happened?

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.400
Don't worry.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.640
I've taken care of it for you.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.030
Cheng.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.360
Take this to feed Bench.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.150
Which one of you cut this?

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.550
I did.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.110
Not bad.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.270
You've got guts.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.010
Didn't you say there were only two people?

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.350
Were you trying to get us killed?

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.960
Yes.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.590
But you two

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.390
came back just fine, didn't you?

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.920
That's true.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.030
So this matter...

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.240
We're even now.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.510
What about Ximei?

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.790
Ximei

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:09.560
said herself

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.830
she wants to stay and work for me.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.000
From now on, we're family.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.910
No distinctions between us.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.960
Tomorrow night,

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.590
it's the same group.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.510
I need to put

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.720
an end to this matter.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.070
You two come with me

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:29.920
to keep watch.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.720
How do we watch?

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.680
It's simple.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.310
If police come, shout a warning.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.300
If enemies come, finish them off.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.550
Dong.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.370
Master Five.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.640
Sorry for making you come all this way.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:49.440
Where are you going?

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.200
They've made their move.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.460
None of your business.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.450
Are you stupid?

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.220
Don't you remember how they messed with us

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:53.990
before?

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:54.940
Come back!

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.510
There are more people upstairs.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.240
Follow me up.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.680
Run!

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.590
How is it?

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.230
Ximei.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.200
Mr. Dao was at the old bridge

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.550
and was stabbed to death
by those guys just now.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:22.550
They'll be coming after us soon.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.280
Leave now.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.200
It's not safe here.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.370
Where should I go?

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.660
Come to my place first.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:28.240
Hurry up!

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.840
They'll be here any minute.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.200
Hurry! Hurry!

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.880
Where should I sit?

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.640
You can sit in the front

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.640
or in the back.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.510
Mr. Dao has been stabbed to death.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.640
Go collect his body!

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:08.110
Why are you squeezing?

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.530
There's no room left in the front.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.420
You're crushing my crotch.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.700
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.360
Why don't you look in the back?

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.110
What's wrong with the back?

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:30.750
Still squeezing?

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:50.640
Xiaojun.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:52.690
Take your bed out.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.400
Put a nail here.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.490
And another one over there.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.070
Tie a wire across.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.390
Hang a sheet to make a partition.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.680
Ximei.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.160
You sleep on the inside.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.170
I'll sleep on the outside.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.719
What about me?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.960
Are you stupid?

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.760
You want to sleep with me?

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.820
Sleep on the floor.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.130
I'll go sleep in the video hall.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.630
Come back.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.100
I'll go to the night market
to buy her a couple of towels.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.429
Otherwise, you expect her to use yours?
