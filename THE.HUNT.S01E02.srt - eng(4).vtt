[THE HUNT]

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.280
Tomorrow morning,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.530
come with me to your husband's family.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.079
[1987, Baorong Village, Nanyang Province]

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.940
You don't need to bring anything.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.710
They're afraid of your late husband's
spirit,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.400
so they won't let you
bring anything there.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.960
Otherwise, he might

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.750
follow you there to seek vengeance

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.870
and cause trouble.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.220
That wouldn't be good.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.579
I mean my son.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.160
He's a boy.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.050
Of course you can bring him there.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.650
When you get there,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.360
you’ll stay in an unused room
for one night.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.400
The day after tomorrow,
you'll get married—

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.460
without a banquet.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.360
So that's the plan.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.430
Tomorrow morning,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.000
I'll pick her up at the village entrance.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.200
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.150
Let me walk you out.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.680
It's okay.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.470
Mom!

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.560
Mom, don't go!

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.080
Mom!

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.800
Mom, wait for me!

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.800
Take me with you!

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.800
Mom!

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.740
Mom, don't go!

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.800
Mom, wait for me!

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.079
Take me with you!

Ximei! Ximei! Ximei!

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.840
Mom!

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.630
Mom, don't go!

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.570
Mom!

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.840
Mom, wait for me!

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.220
I will come back to see you in a few days.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.870
Be a good girl.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.540
Listen to Grandma

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.980
and Uncle.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.360
A bride doesn't look back

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.590
so she won't bring bad luck.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.840
Let's go.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.300
Your mom

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.970
is going to her new home
for a better life.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.200
Be a good girl, Ximei.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.900
I'm not being good!

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.750
Otherwise, why did Mom

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.680
only take my little brother

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.470
but not me?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.210
Ximei, you're a big girl now.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.380
You should be a good girl.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.180
I don't want to be a good girl!

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.430
[Behind her, flames are burning;]

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.750
I want my mom!

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.350
Mom, come back!

[1996, Baorong Village, Nanyang Province]

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.540
It's okay. I'll handle it.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.430
Fuchang is a good boy.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.120
He helps out.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.670
Fuchang's face is so dark,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.480
like a dark-skinned sugarcane.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.680
You're a black-skinned sugarcane too.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.990
You're laughing?

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.950
You're just too honest.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.950
Whatever others say, you accept it.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.810
If you ask me,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.840
that Guo Adi

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.040
is an honest man.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.750
He has a wife.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.630
He had a wife.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.630
But now…

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.160
didn't she run away?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.240
She ran away to escape his beatings.

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.140
Some people say

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.780
his wife was beaten to death by him

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.510
and buried somewhere.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.800
That's just the villagers

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.380
spreading rumors because they're jealous

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.450
of his money.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.020
He stinks. His house stinks even more.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.190
You can smell it from far away.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.890
That's because he dries fish powder

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.530
at home.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.970
If you don't like it, just tell him not to

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.780
after you marry him.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.240
He'll definitely listen to you.

I won't marry him.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.620
I won't marry him no matter what.

Our family raised you,

and it wasn't easy.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.160
You should repay our kindness.

how can he?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.640
He's your cousin.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.690
That's right.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.430
Do you plan

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.950
to live off this family

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.270

You sold my mom,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.140
and now you're selling me!

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.090
What are you talking about?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.140
They've already prepared

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.220
the bride price.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.390
You guys make the choice yourselves.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.510
I'm done with this matter.

Don't go, Mrs. Zhou!

Fuchang?

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.450
What's so good about Fuchang?

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.290
His family is so poor

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.120
he can't even afford pants.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.780
And he's mute.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.260
He can't even afford the engagement money.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.480
You'll be poor your whole life with him.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.430
I'm not afraid of being poor.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.060
If I have to get married,
I'll marry Fuchang.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.700
You think you have a choice?

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.020
You're so young,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.220
and you want to choose your own husband?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.120
Shameless.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.330
I know you don't want to get married
right now,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.420
but from your grandma to your mom,

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.360
including your auntie—

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.950
haven't all the women

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.950
gotten through it the same way?

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.500
Be good.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.870
In the future,

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.340
once you have a child,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.159
you will

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.810
gradually settle down.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.090
You're young

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.510
and beautiful.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.030
You'll live better

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.290
Pay your respects to your grandma

one last time.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.040
After the mourning period,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.980
just marry him.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.800
Be good, Ximei.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.890
Listen to your uncle.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.390
It's all for your own good.

You and Cao Xiaojun

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.890
registered your marriage in 2004.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:43.789
Why did you say

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.080
you got married at 16?

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.270
Actually, Xiaojun...

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.120
was my 2nd husband.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.400
I was

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.750
married once before.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.390
No more drinking!

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.440
If I drink more,

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.200
it'll ruin my good day.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.480
I'll come to your place tomorrow,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.570
and we'll drink then,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.440
okay?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.550
Stop looking! Stop looking!

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.490
Go!

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:53.880
Don't look anymore.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.320
What's that pillow for?

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.560
I heard when remarrying,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.830
on the first night,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.470
you need to place a pillow
for the first wife's spirit.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.630
And we're not supposed to…

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.910
The first wife's spirit? Nonsense!

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.390
What a bad omen.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.710
Take off your clothes.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.550
These need to be returned tomorrow.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.870
Take them off!

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.100
I was still young back then.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.360
We couldn't get a marriage certificate.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.610
We just

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.470
had a small wedding banquet.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.940
Thinking about it now,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.970
I was really

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.130
a gambler back then.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.000
I staked my whole life

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.480
on Guo Adi,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.770
betting that...

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.800
he had a conscience,

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.350
that he would be grateful,

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.440
that he would treat me well.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:38.910
And?

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.080
I won the bet.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.050
He treated me very well.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.580
He gave me

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.270
all the good food and drinks.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.060
He cherished me dearly

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.960
and never hurt me.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.150
Of course, we bickered sometimes.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.260
Living together is like

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.180
using a spoon to stir in a pot—

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.080
there are always little bumps.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.840
My grandma once told me,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.870
"Suffering is a blessing.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:17.630
Just endure it

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.000
in this life;

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.740
it will be better in the next."

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.760
You went to the village clinic, right?

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.480
What did He say?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.870
Well...

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:02.600
He said

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.220
I might not be getting enough nutrition
lately,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.680
so my period is irregular.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.880
So you're not pregnant?

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.110
He's just a village doctor.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.390
He knows nothing.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.320
You should go to the town hospital

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.380
in a couple of days.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.830
Oh,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.910
when I was visiting the family graves,

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.150
I caught a gecko.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.960
Later, take out that bottle

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.840
at home for making liquor

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.870
and wash it.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.000
This afternoon,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.030
I'll buy some double-distilled liquor

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.150
and make medicinal wine myself.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.600
Okay.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.640
Buddha, please bless us.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.910
Bless Guo Adi to be kind,

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.630
so I can have some peaceful days.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.740
Adi, have some tea.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.630
Tea?

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.080
Do you know how people outside

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.120
laugh at me?

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.750
Why can't you have a child?

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.670
Why can't you?

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.390
You know, if you can't give me a son,

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.510
you won't even be buried
in our ancestral grave after death.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.440
Adi, I'll go to town tomorrow.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.670
Come with me.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.190
You think there's something wrong with me?

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.390
What's wrong with me?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.720
What's wrong with me?

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.790
What's wrong with me?

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.750
You think it's my problem, right?

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.720
What nonsense

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.790
did you

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:54.490
hear about me?

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.060
What did those quack doctors say about me?

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:56.900
Tell me!

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.360
What did they say?

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.290
You can't have children.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.140
So why did I even marry you?

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.240
It's not me!

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.430
What's not you?

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.349
Tell me!

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:06.940
Didn't your previous wife

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.339
fail to get pregnant too?

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.900
If you want a child,

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.730
Adi, let's go to the hospital together.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.150
Let's go together, okay?

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.300
Go to the hospital?

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.510
What's wrong with me?

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.109
Tell me!

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.010
Xiang!

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:18.790
Stop hitting her!

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.050
If you keep hitting her, she'll die.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:20.569
Enough,

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:21.829
Adi, if you beat your wife to death,

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:22.530
no one will give you children.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:23.060
Get lost!

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.870
Mind your own family's

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.540
business!

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.720
One day,

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.210
I'll beat you too!

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.490
Get lost!

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.660
Why can't you have children?

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.110
Have a child!

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.680
Grandma,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.180
you said that having a child

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.620
would make life better.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.880
But I can't have children.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.330
Because I can't have children,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.090
is this how my life should be?

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.270
I've always been well-behaved

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.720
and obedient.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.270
I listen to you,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.720
to Uncle and Auntie,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.440
and to Guo Adi.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.640
I listen to all of you.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.400
So how did my life

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.640
end up like this?

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.010
Is this the "peaceful life"

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.790
you promised?

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.830
I know

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.070
I can only blame my bad luck.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.920
I'm scared.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.070
I can't hold on much longer.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.000
After I die,

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.000
I don't want to be buried
in their ancestral grave.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.830
I'm keeping this cigarette for myself.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.430
Hong Kong people smoke this.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.510
Foreigners too.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.930
Here, take this.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.480
I won't smoke.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.070
I can't smoke anymore.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.170
What took you so long?

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.680
I've been waiting for ages.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.290
We have a guest?

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:31.650
Come.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.410
Come on in.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.640
Have a seat.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.960
Sit down.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:35.920
Okay.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.890
Let me introduce you.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.260
This is Sanli's youngest son,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.440
Wei.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:46.750
Wei.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.810
By...

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.040
seniority...

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.640
he should call you...

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.480
Sister-in-law.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:54.740
What sister-in-law?

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.740
It doesn't matter what you call her.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.340
He's a member of the Guo family.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.370
We're all family.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.030
Come back.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:05.650
Don't go.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.240
Don't go.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.170
This...

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:08.160
Come.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.440
Sit.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.030
Have a seat.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:18.960
Here.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.040
Have a drink.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.030
Wei

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.160
and his older brother

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.240
are in the smuggling business.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.550
They make good money.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.810
These prawns

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.770
were brought by him.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.640
Look how big they are.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.240
You two have a drink.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.100
Have a drink.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:47.960
Drink.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.580
This liquor

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.870
was specially made for you.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.860
Seahorse and gecko wine.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.350
Very nourishing.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.720
Wei.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.790
What are you doing, Adi?

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:28.360
Shut up!

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.190
Stop yelling!

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:30.520
Wei!

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.530
Wei!

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.760
Don't!

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:33.320
Wei!

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.000
Don't!

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.480
Wei!

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.020
I'm begging you, Adi!

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.000
Please!

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.580
Wei!

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.540
Wei! Don't!

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.240
No, Wei! Don't!

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.800
I just want a son!

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.380
I just want a son!

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.480
I want a son!

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.170
I want a son!

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.000
Come on!

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.000
Give me a son!

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.440
Give me a son!

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.030
Don't embarrass me anymore!

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.270
Say something!

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.630
Get up!

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.680
I want chicken soup!

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.830
Make it!

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.350
Ximei.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.000
You regret marrying me, don't you?

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.030
You're a good woman.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:30.930
A good woman.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.270
I'm not a bad person.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.030
He'll come back

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.000
after this trip.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.110
You'd better get pregnant.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.830
At that time, Adi and his cousin

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.510
were running Dafei,

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.490
which were speedboats.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.370
Those boats

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.020
had 4 or 5 engines mounted on the back.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:48.680
Smuggling?

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.240
Yes.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.530
Back then I was too young

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:50.280
Where is she?

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:52.440
Where's she?

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:53.440
She's upstairs.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.230
Come down now!

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.050
What are you doing up there?

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:06.450
Hurry up!

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.060
What are you doing?

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.050
Be quiet.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.210
We're running a business here.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.190
How can we do business

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.390
if you keep shouting?

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.190
Mr. Dao.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.110
Hello.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.280
Come down.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.230
Wash my hair.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.110
Come on.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:28.860
Are you messing around?

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:35.800
Get out.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.440
The towel.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.640
It's in the cabinet.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.700
Bring me the towel.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.480
I'm sorry.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.490
I don't know how to do this.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.000
Where are you from?

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.280
Baorong Village.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.420
Baorong Village?
