WEBVTT

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.879
Miss.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.760
Little girl.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.640
I wanted to tidy it up.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.320
You're wearing so little.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.680
you can't blame me.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.840
What's going on?

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.120
Isn't that Zhou Mu?

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.000
He ran to us.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.120
Why didn't you notice?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.039
Are you crazy?

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.960
Why are you following me?

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.600
Scum!

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.840
Lu Jinjing, are you okay?

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.000
Zhou Mu, why are you here?

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.080
You...

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.960
Is he okay?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.720
He's fine. He's not badly injured.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.520
He'll wake up soon.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.040
He's quite stubborn.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.440
You really don't need to go to the hospital?

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.160
No.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.240
I know his body.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.600
I knocked him out

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.480
I knocked him out.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.800
to save the damsel.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.840
Who needs his help?

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.079
I almost ruined the plan.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.720
What a coincidence.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.360
You must be a couple of seven generations.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.640
What are you talking about?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.800
Enough.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.680
Let's get down to business.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.560
Take him away.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.560
Okay.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.480
Hurry up.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.079
Don't move.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.200
Are you going to torture me again?

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.560
This man is evil.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.560
We have to do something.

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:58.960
This is illegal.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.120
Just send him to the police station.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.800
How can you betray me?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.600
Go away.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.680
No.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.240
Your blood will flow out little by little.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.120
Don't worry. It won't hurt.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.840
Think about

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.600
those girls you defiled.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.840
I'm sorry.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.320
Please let me go.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.560
Please.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.800
I'm dying.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.520
Let you go.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.440
The girls you hurt

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.000
begged you in the same way.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.280
I know I was wrong.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.880
Take me to the hospital.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.079
My blood!

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.920
My blood is going to drain.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.520
In normal situations,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.079
the speed of blood

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.960
is 18 to 22 cm per second.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.440
The more emotional he is,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.720
the faster the blood will flow.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.520
If you don't stop the bleeding in nine minutes,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.800
his life will be in danger

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.160
due to the decline.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.240
What you can do is to stay calm

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.640
and slow down the bleeding.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.120
One minute has passed.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.600
You have eight minutes.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.720
to confess your crime.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.880
I'll tell you.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.600
We have an alliance called hunter.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.600
A foreign car shop.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.240
The veteran drivers are all inside.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.320
We are responsible for delivering goods to the higher-ups.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.400
The rest of the anesthetic is used to make women unconscious.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.280
Delivery? What delivery?

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.680
I knew it was a huge system.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.720
Someone is responsible for kidnapping.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.480
There are people who send messages.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.880
and the ones who solve problems with violence.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.240
I'm in charge of transportation.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.640
Are you human? Go on.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.200
I'm just an underling.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.200
I don't know anything.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.080
I used the anesthesia myself.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.320
It feels good.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.720
I didn't do anything else.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.400
A few days ago...

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.160
The girl who was killed a few days ago.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.080
who was killed a few days ago?

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.480
It wasn't me. It was Cao Cong.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.400
That girl resisted.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.560
He killed that woman

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.880
he killed that woman.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.120
Where is he?

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.040
He went back to his hometown as soon as something happened.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.880
Things have been stable lately.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.200
He just returned to the workshop today.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.640
Please.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.000
Please send me off.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.320
I have a family.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.640
I have a family, right?

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.120
Does it help?

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.800
Did my sister beg you the same?

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.920
Who do you think she is?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.080
Do you think she's your prey?

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.640
I'll help you.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.480
I'll help you.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.720
They are human too.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.440
She's human too.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.400
She must be human too.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.200
The blood is going to dry.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.920
The blood is going to dry.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.240
We can't catch the driver of the foreign car shop.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.360
Why not?

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.880
This foreign car shop is

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.280
in our city.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.040
Its annual tax

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.520
more than all the merchants in this street.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.360
If you arrest the driver,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.040
how can I explain to the foreign car shop?

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.520
What should I tell the higher-ups?

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.920
What should I tell the victim's family?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.560
Isn't there

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.040
Cao Cong?

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:52.480
You can just get him back.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.440
They're doing human trafficking.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.440
Do you have evidence?

00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.920
I have evidence.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.240
You're a cop too.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.160
It's clearly stated in the police law.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.520
you canâ€™t sign a warrant

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.240
without solid evidence.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.280
You caught them all.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.760
How?

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.360
If we can't find anything,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.360
what will the police say to them?

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.520
I'll find out.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.760
Don't worry.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.800
Mu, sit down.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.960
Let me tell you.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600
In cases like this,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.120
no victim will testify.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.200
Even if we are the police,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.360
sometimes we have to compromise.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.240
They did so many evil things.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.280
You have to compromise.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.960
Do you deserve to be a police officer?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.240
Did you take bribes from him?

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.080
How dare you say that to your father?

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.120
Listen, Zhou Mu.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.040
the police won't give you any money.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.280
Do you want to die?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.320
Catch it yourself.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.320
Boss, are you really going alone?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.280
Yes, I will.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.960
But it's dangerous.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.880
There are dozens of them.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.040
No.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.560
I want to go with you.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.240
Good job, Qin Shan.
