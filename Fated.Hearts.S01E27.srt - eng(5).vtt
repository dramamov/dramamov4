Feng Suige,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.560
I know I'm doomed to fail.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.880
I can clear your mother's name,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.170
but you must solemnly swear

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.840
to spare

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.500
the Zhuang family after I die.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.790
Feng Suige,

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.680
I took Wei Qingyu's life.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.320
Only I am the killer of your mother.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.280
Come at me!

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.030

with the feuds between us.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.180
You should take revenge on me.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.360
Don't hurt her.

Feng Suige!

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.190
I demand you tell everyone

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.860
why you killed her.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.910
I'm responsible for your mother's death.

Your mother was killed by no one but me.

Come at me. I dare you!

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.280
Take my life! Let my father go!

Will you confess or not?

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.329
I, Zhuang Shen, will
take full responsibility for my actions.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.720
All I've done has nothing

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.680
to do with my daughter,

avenge your mother by taking my life.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.720
Do not hurt my family.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.240
You're in no position
to negotiate terms with me!

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.310
I'll ask you one last time.

and now I've completely lost.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.520
Indeed, you've won.

But it's simply because you're in luck.

She was not a spy for Jinxiu.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.270
I just fabricated evidence

Yes.

Thank you for the effort.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.780
I shouldn't have come to Yujing City.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.390
I'm physically and mentally exhausted.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.200
Look, the room's filled with patients.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.130
And previously,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.000
after fixing your hand

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.510
and saving Ning Fei's life,

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.320
I rushed to the imperial palace

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.150
immediately

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.600
to treat Feng Pingcheng.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.260
I didn't sleep or rest.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.670
That guy Feng Pingcheng is the worst.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.390
I put in so much effort

in curing an ungrateful man!

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.670
For saving so many lives,

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.830
you're literally a living god.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.690
A living god?

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.960
I think my trip to Yujing City

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.510
is for trials and tribulations.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.960
I'll leave
as soon as I finish this cup of tea,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.420
without a moment's delay.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.870
In my opinion, your trip to Yujing City

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.200
is to help others
through trials and tribulations.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.800
Don't think I didn't notice.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.360
When you were treating patients,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.560
you spared no effort.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.630
You helped several people
at a time all by yourself.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.120
You're not only proficient in medicine,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.850
but also ready to give your all.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.290
You always claim

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.360
to never fight for the living
against the Grim Reaper.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.150
But in fact,

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.320
you'd hate to see

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.840
any lives around you being taken

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.210
by the Grim Reaper.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.770
What a smooth talker you are.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.980
A perceptive observer, too.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.150
I'm telling you,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.320

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.920
Move aside!

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.920
[Imperial Study]

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.720
Let the Empress in!

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.860
[Imperial Study]

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.000
Celebrate victories with drinks—

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.920
who said that?

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.880
Miss Yixiao said it.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.960
But doesn't His Highness often tell us

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.240
to always keep our composure?

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.310
Why is he hanging on Miss Yixiao's

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.000
every word now?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.920
What do you think the reason is?

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.680
Can you take a break

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.310
from archery practice
and use your brain for once?

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.590
We're drinking already.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.590
Go on. Have more.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.310
Drink as much as you can!

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.400
-Sure!
-Great!

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.380
Catch this!

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.330
Here comes more booze.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.000
Come on.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:35.720
Cheers!

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.160
Bottoms up! Come on!

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.270
With this drink down,

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.070
may we have many more victories!

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.970
Your Highness.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:48.510
Come on.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:51.040
Let me fill Your Highness's glass.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.950
On this joyful occasion,

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.690
let's forgo the formalities.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.830
Really?

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.510
Then pardon me for boldly

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.920
calling you "Chief"!

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:01.550
Okay.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.870
As you please.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:04.640
Chief!

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.880
There's a performance for you.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.410
Yun Fang!

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.550
Come here.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.280
Stop eating.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.720
You practiced for a sword dance, right?

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.960
Perform it for His Highness.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.590
Do it now.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:14.650
Your Highness,

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.920
why not let me perform a sword dance?

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.720
That's right.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.400
Would you like to see it?

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.350
Don't go to all that trouble.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.550
Just enjoy the feast.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:22.920
Then get a good sleep.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.640
Alright then. Let's eat.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:25.550
Enjoy the feast.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.920
Let's listen to Mrs. Feng from now on.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.310
Sure!

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.110
We'll all listen to Mrs. Feng.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.790
Guys,

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.420
let's do as Mrs. Feng says!

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.480
We'll do as Mrs. Feng says!

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.070
Do as Mrs. Feng says!

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.920
You see,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.070
His Highness is my chief.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.420
I should respect you as Mrs. Feng, right?

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.550
Oh my.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.240
Look how shy His Highness is.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.480
That's not someone shy would do!

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.550
Alright.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.510
Seriously,

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.240
not all of you

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.000
get to call her

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.730
"Mrs. Feng."

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.240
Only I have that privilege.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:25:59.950
Says who?

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.640
All of us are His Majesty's buddies.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.070
We should call her "Mrs. Feng"!

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.790
Am I right, guys?

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:04.310
Right!

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.970
-Mrs. Feng!
-Mrs. Feng!

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.550
Mrs. Feng!

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.160
He who chants again
will be punished with drinks!

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:13.830
Mrs. Feng would like to

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.790
-punish us with drinks!
-Drinks!

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.790
Raise our glasses!

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.270
Come on!

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:23.440
Mrs. Feng,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.240
I'll drink this up to show my respect,

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.640
since I'm bad with words.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:29.800
Mrs. Feng,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.600
thank you.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.790
His Highness has finally taken revenge.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.350
The credit goes to all of you.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.950
Thank you for your hard work.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Here's a toast to you!

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.880
-To Mrs. Feng!
-To Mrs. Feng!

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.200
Guys,

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.350
many thanks for your efforts.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.210
I'd like to make a toast to you all!

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.030
-To Chief!
-To Chief!

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.130
Come on!

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:02.770
Drink up!

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.510
Now that you're here,

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.160
just feel free to

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.640
speak your mind.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.400
Today marks

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.680
the end of our marriage.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.130
There will be no need

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.020
to see each other again
in the rest of our lives.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.480
I'm not here

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.880
to salvage our marriage.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.160
I'm here for Chengyang.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.350
For Chengyang?

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:39.440
What now?

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.200
Hearing that the First Prince

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.130
has completely severed ties with me,

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.200
you can't wait to secure
the throne for Chengyang?

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:52.960
Now, I finally realize

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.000
how you actually think of me.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.200
What you're really like

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.080
doesn't matter anymore.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.400
I will not pass the throne
on to Chengyang.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.550
Get that idea out of your mind.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.960
If anyone

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.070
is to shoulder the blame,

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.600
it should be me, his mother.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.650
Your Majesty,
please don't take it out on Chengyang.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.030
I'll bestow

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.830
the title of Grand Prince on him.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.270
As long as he assists his brother
with loyalty,

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.270
he can live the rest of his life

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.720
peacefully.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.590
Loyalty?

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.790
How is he supposed to serve

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.160
the killer of his grandfather
with loyalty?

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.030
How is he supposed to

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:47.070
forget what happened

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.400
when he knows it was all true?

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.830
As a member of the royal family,

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.270
he has no other choice.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.350
This is his fate.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:56.590
Besides,

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.920
though I'll make him a Grand Prince,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.960
he won't be allowed to step

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.240
out of Yujing.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.510
This is in the best interests

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.330
of him and his brother.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.240
I will not

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.570
dismiss you from the position of Empress.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.160
Isn't it

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.350
what you want most?

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.400
Thank you,

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.550
Your Majesty.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.270
I'm tired.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.240
You may leave.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.590
Can I dress

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.370
Your Majesty's hair for one last time?

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.350
After today,

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.440
we will never meet again.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.720
Despite all my mistakes,

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.310
I've truly given Your Majesty my heart.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.970
My affection for Your Majesty is genuine.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.240
Your Majesty looks pallid,
after just recovering

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.570
from a serious illness.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.680
I would hate to have any regrets

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.590
on the day of our parting.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.400
Please grant my wish, Your Majesty.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.790
Is this

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.310
your one last request?

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.110
Yes.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.080
Your wish is granted.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.350
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.440
Your Majesty,

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.310
Chengyang does have a choice.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.920
I won't leave him with no choice.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.170
My son shall not cave in to fate!

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.680
Guards...

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.070
Guards!

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.920
Help...

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.070
Murong...

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.750
Wait!

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.270
I've already...

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.270
pardoned...

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.480
Protect... Suige...

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.790
Protect...

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.020
Your Majesty,

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.550
I'll settle

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.920
this matter for you.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.480
Will Your Majesty

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.150
help my son Yao?

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.640
Yes. You have my word.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.210
Many thanks,

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.960
Your Majesty.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:06.630
Your Majesty,

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:07.550
our priority

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.760
is to keep His Majesty's death

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.310
secret.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.030
I will then

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.320
take care of the rest.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.920
Harder! Harder! Harder!

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.070
Harder!

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.590
Use more strength!

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.340
Harder!

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:37.070
Harder!

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:38.070
Try harder!

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.510
-Drink up!
-Drink up!

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.800
Come on!

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.040
[Imperial Study]

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:21.000
[Imperial Study]

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:22.440
-Eunuch Ma.
-Your Grace.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.030
Don't go in yet.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.800
Why, Your Grace?

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.480
I have a report

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.940
to make to His Majesty now.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.000
Eunuch Ma,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.670
you are His Majesty's most trusted person.

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:29.440
I'm sure His Majesty

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.880
would always heed what you say.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.510
I'm very flattered, Your Grace.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:33.230
His Majesty

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.050
would not blindly take my word.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:37.270
[Imperial Study]

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.320
I must save my son.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.110
You have to help me.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.550
Please don't put me in a pickle,
Your Grace.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:47.520
I'd love to help,

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.440
but there's nothing I can do.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.060
[Imperial Study]

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:25.780
[Imperial Study]

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.720
To the palace.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.360
Father.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.760
Yao,

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.290
all of this was done by the Empress.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.310
Uncle,

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:11.570
I've taken care of

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:12.360
[General of Jinwu Guards, Murong Jie]

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.360
all the Jinwu Guards outside,

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.760
except those on our side.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.340
I'll go out and keep watch.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.130
Father...

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.840
In order to save you,

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.670
Feng Pingcheng must die.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.980
Next,

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.620
Feng Suige will have to die too.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.690
I believe you've realized

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.670
the Murong family

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.290
has reached the point of no return.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.210
No. I'm the only rebel here.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.550
I'm the one
who's hit the point of no return.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:48.440
You and the rest

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.440
of the Murong family are innocent.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.440
Father,

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.230
I can't drag you into this mess.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:55.480
Please leave right now.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.030
What happened here

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.960
tonight was all my doing.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.760
I'll bear all the consequences.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.320
Go!

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.280
Remember this:

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.960
there are consequences

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.280
to every decision you make.

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:09.070
This decision I'm making results from

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.960
the fact that I can't bear

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:12.800
the consequence of losing you.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.250
Only you are the most important
to the Murong family.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Your Highness...

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:17.780
What's up?

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.740
Your Highness,

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.150
His Majesty has fallen ill again.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:21.190
Mr. Ma asked me to bring Your Highness

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:22.590
to the palace right away.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.800
Please leave.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.590
But...

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.830
Mr. Ma said

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.590
His Majesty

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.250
was at death's door this time.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.400
Where is His Majesty?

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.260
Your Highness,

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.590
His Majesty is in the Imperial Study.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:39.880
Why not in the bed chamber?

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.190
Since His Majesty suddenly fell ill

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.440
in the Imperial Study,

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.300
Mr. Ma summoned
all the imperial physicians there.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.360
Here is the Imperial Study.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.070
Your Highness,

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.470
I shall take my leave now.

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:52.520
[Imperial Study]

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:56.270
[Imperial Study]

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.590
[Imperial Study]

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:21.980
I didn't want to see you,

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.560
but they told me you fell ill again.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.800
Your Majesty!

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.830
Your Majesty!

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.120
Your Majesty!

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.280
Uncle Murong...

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.000
Did you do all of this?

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.280
Why?
