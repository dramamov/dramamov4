00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:01.587
If you don't incorporate my feedback,

00:00:02.032 --> 00:00:03.832
I'm not approving the design.

00:00:05.332 --> 00:00:06.602
I'm not doing it.

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:09.802
I'm the client, and you're refusing my request?

00:00:11.472 --> 00:00:13.212
You're unbelievable.

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:15.742
I'm telling you I'm fine,

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:18.752
so why do you have a problem with it? Why?

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:20.482
Seriously, what is your deal?

00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:23.222
I don't know. I don't know why I'm doing this.

00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:24.822
I guess I must like you.

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:31.122
So?

00:00:32.192 --> 00:00:33.562
So, what will you do about it?

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:37.502
What? Are you going to ask me out or something?

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:39.632
Dream on.

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:42.902
You need to sort out your feelings on your own, you know?

00:00:45.142 --> 00:00:46.172
So she knew?

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:50.782
I'm going to step out for a minute.

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:52.582
Pull yourself together while I'm gone.

00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:04.732
(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

00:01:05.892 --> 00:01:08.102
Of all the stunts to pull. Seriously.

00:01:11.232 --> 00:01:13.532
Does he realise how many times he's caught me off guard?

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:14.702
I guess he figured if he said that,

00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:18.072
I'd be flustered and speechless. Unbelievable.

00:01:19.472 --> 00:01:21.612
And why is he sticking his nose into my nap room?

00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:25.112
When is he going to drop that whole "I'm your senior" act?

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:33.852
Lee Ji Hyuk, you crazy fool.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.762
I guess I must like you.

00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:39.992
You need to sort out your feelings on your own, you know?

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:43.732
So it was that obvious.

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:46.102
And I thought I was hiding it so well.

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:48.472
But still,

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.612
how could she shut me down like that in a split second?

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.612
I knew it would never work out anyway.

00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:56.242
Never make that mistake again.

00:01:57.012 --> 00:01:58.752
Just stick to work.

00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:06.922
How am I going to smooth this over?

00:02:18.502 --> 00:02:19.932
Oh, hey.

00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:22.872
Take the blueprints and review them. I'll get your feedback tomorrow.

00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:25.872
And don't tell me what to do with my own personal space.

00:02:26.672 --> 00:02:29.312
Just mark down anything you want to add or revise.

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:32.382
All right.

00:02:52.032 --> 00:02:53.532
She won't even hear me out.

00:02:54.332 --> 00:02:56.872
I was nice to you because you lived and worked hard.

00:02:57.472 --> 00:02:58.472
Remember your place.

00:02:59.642 --> 00:03:03.142
Stay away. I don't have to give someone a chance...

00:03:04.382 --> 00:03:05.982
if I don't think they suit me.

00:03:07.482 --> 00:03:08.482
Do I, Eun Oh?

00:03:11.052 --> 00:03:12.122
Is she throwing it back in my face?

00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:16.722
So she knew I liked her all along and was just pretending she didn't?

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:19.792
I'm losing my mind.

00:03:22.662 --> 00:03:23.662
Son.

00:03:26.032 --> 00:03:27.432
By the way, lately...

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:30.772
Are you and Ji Hyuk having one? A war of nerves.

00:03:31.072 --> 00:03:32.072
Oh, please.

00:03:32.642 --> 00:03:35.112
What father has a war of nerves with his son?

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.612
I'm just really upset with Ji Hyuk, that's all.

00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:41.052
Don't give me that. Honestly.

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:43.752
Fathers and sons.

00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:46.192
It's always man to man. That's just how it is.

00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:50.022
It was like that when you grew up, and I've seen it all over.

00:03:50.622 --> 00:03:53.932
Once a son becomes a man, they both try not to back down.

00:03:53.992 --> 00:03:55.662
That's what a war of nerves is.

00:03:56.132 --> 00:03:59.032
I was never like that with my own father.

00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:01.402
Oh, please. Of course, you were.

00:04:02.772 --> 00:04:04.472
Whenever your father would say something,

00:04:04.742 --> 00:04:06.472
you'd say, "I'll handle it myself."

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:09.542
Then your father would fly off the handle,

00:04:09.812 --> 00:04:13.552
and then you two wouldn't speak to each other for over two weeks.

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:16.382
Well, back then,

00:04:17.052 --> 00:04:18.922
it was probably because Dad was being unreasonable.

00:04:21.692 --> 00:04:23.322
But now...

00:04:24.062 --> 00:04:25.892
You're the father now, aren't you?

00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:29.132
How can a parent ever win against their own child?

00:04:30.602 --> 00:04:34.072
Why does a parent always have to be the one to give in?

00:04:34.532 --> 00:04:36.442
No, it's not about winning.

00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:41.542
He's 33 now. He's old enough to know better,

00:04:41.642 --> 00:04:45.812
but he insists he's always right. I should discipline him.

00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:47.582
Oh, good grief.

00:04:48.652 --> 00:04:51.322
I guess it's true what they say about fathers and sons being beasts.

00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:01.762
You're back already.

00:05:02.862 --> 00:05:03.862
Yes, because of your grandma.

00:05:03.862 --> 00:05:05.902
I had a feeling you'd come home because of her.

00:05:06.432 --> 00:05:07.602
So you didn't leave after all?

00:05:08.302 --> 00:05:09.802
I told you I wasn't leaving.

00:05:09.902 --> 00:05:13.442
I know, you brat. Of course, you're brazen enough to stay.

00:05:15.812 --> 00:05:16.812
Ji Hyuk.

00:05:17.242 --> 00:05:19.052
What brings you home so early?

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:20.682
Because of Father.

00:05:22.052 --> 00:05:23.382
You were right.

00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:26.022
- Have you eaten? - Not yet.

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:27.222
Okay.

00:05:27.552 --> 00:05:29.292
It's about time my son got a home-cooked meal.

00:05:29.592 --> 00:05:32.092
- Go wash up. I'll set the table. - Okay.

00:05:32.662 --> 00:05:36.362
What, does he not have hands? Tell him to make his own dinner.

00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:38.172
Mom, it's okay. I'll get it myself.

00:05:42.602 --> 00:05:43.702
Just go wash up.

00:05:48.512 --> 00:05:50.512
It's that soy-braised pork Dad loves.

00:05:53.012 --> 00:05:54.282
Oh, it's good.

00:05:56.722 --> 00:05:57.882
What is it? Do you need something?

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.192
Mom.

00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:02.192
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:06:03.492 --> 00:06:04.562
About what?

00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:06.832
You must have your own take on this, right?

00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:10.002
Like telling me to apologise to Father or something?

00:06:10.862 --> 00:06:11.872
No.

00:06:12.732 --> 00:06:15.572
I don't know exactly why your father's acting this way,

00:06:15.772 --> 00:06:17.872
and frankly, I don't know why you are either.

00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:21.982
Since I don't know the whole story, how can I tell you two what to do?

00:06:22.412 --> 00:06:23.682
You two sort it out yourselves.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:25.352
Just...

00:06:25.682 --> 00:06:27.682
don't go raising your voices in the house.

00:06:29.582 --> 00:06:30.582
I'll try to be careful.

00:06:31.752 --> 00:06:32.892
By the way, Ji Hyuk...

00:06:33.952 --> 00:06:36.522
Let's just drop the whole thing about living expenses.

00:06:36.962 --> 00:06:37.962
Come on, Mom.

00:06:38.262 --> 00:06:40.692
I agree with your father on that.

00:06:41.032 --> 00:06:43.902
So let's not talk about it anymore.

00:06:44.502 --> 00:06:46.172
Fine. For now.

00:06:46.902 --> 00:06:48.772
Ji Hyuk, you got home early.

00:06:49.502 --> 00:06:52.012
I saw Dad's shoes by the door. Is he home too?

00:06:52.572 --> 00:06:53.942
Yes, he's in his room.

00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:56.312
So, Ji Hyuk was totally right.

00:06:56.642 --> 00:06:57.882
How did he guess that?

00:06:58.952 --> 00:07:00.012
Dad!

00:07:00.312 --> 00:07:01.782
The nerve of that kid...

00:07:02.452 --> 00:07:03.822
"I knew you'd be back?"

00:07:04.182 --> 00:07:07.292
What does he know, acting so smug? That brat.

00:07:08.892 --> 00:07:10.662
- Dad. - Yes, hey.

00:07:10.662 --> 00:07:11.762
I'm home.

00:07:13.462 --> 00:07:17.462
Dad, where did you sleep last night? Do you know how worried I was?

00:07:18.332 --> 00:07:19.472
I'm sorry about that.

00:07:19.932 --> 00:07:22.602
Next time you have a fight like that, make sure I'm home.

00:07:22.872 --> 00:07:24.972
I'll kick Ji Hyuk out for you.

00:07:25.242 --> 00:07:27.972
Oh, sweetie. What could you do? You silly kid.

00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:39.022
Three units left at Hyunmyeong Apts, with no defect claims so far.

00:07:39.152 --> 00:07:41.422
We've started on five units at the Ohyang Apartments,

00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:44.122
and we're prepping for construction on 27 homes at Yeonseong Apartments.

00:07:45.092 --> 00:07:46.562
What's the status on our hiring search?

00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:49.162
The application deadline is this week,

00:07:49.162 --> 00:07:50.502
and interviews are next week,

00:07:51.102 --> 00:07:53.272
but individual contracts are flooding in.

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:55.272
We need to hire a site manager first.

00:07:56.942 --> 00:07:58.342
When would you like to meet?

00:08:03.542 --> 00:08:05.882
(Ji Eun Oh)

00:08:05.982 --> 00:08:07.212
(I want a mini-showroom with an open layout.)

00:08:07.282 --> 00:08:08.582
(The materials list will be sent today.)

00:08:08.652 --> 00:08:10.452
I want a mini-showroom with an open layout,

00:08:10.452 --> 00:08:12.122
so the staff can move around and work comfortably.

00:08:12.652 --> 00:08:14.752
The materials list will be sent today.

00:08:16.992 --> 00:08:18.562
I asked to set up a meeting, and this is what I get?

00:08:19.692 --> 00:08:22.432
He's so ridiculously fickle. It's unforgivable.

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:25.002
He's the one who let it slip.

00:08:32.072 --> 00:08:34.142
Oh? Ms. Ji.

00:08:34.712 --> 00:08:35.782
Hello.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:39.082
Good timing. I was about to send you Lee Ri Na and Kim Ji Seon's...

00:08:39.082 --> 00:08:41.722
- final turnkey project plans. - I see.

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:44.522
I'm actually here to meet with Mr. Lee.

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.852
I sent you a text about that.

00:08:47.922 --> 00:08:51.122
I'm having lunch with the staff today.

00:08:52.262 --> 00:08:53.492
Then I'll just join you.

00:09:02.072 --> 00:09:04.002
Cheol Min, you want to grab lunch with us?

00:09:05.972 --> 00:09:08.682
I avoid the lunch rush. It's always too packed.

00:09:17.522 --> 00:09:21.192
I have that lunch meeting with the newly signed coordinators.

00:09:21.192 --> 00:09:22.362
I told you, remember?

00:09:26.192 --> 00:09:28.662
- Was that today? - Yes.

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:32.602
I guess Mr. Lee is so busy, he must've mixed up the dates.

00:09:34.002 --> 00:09:35.102
I guess it's just you and me, then.

00:09:44.942 --> 00:09:47.952
No one's in the elevator. And it's lunchtime.

00:09:49.252 --> 00:09:50.282
Right!

00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:51.992
So, I was thinking...

00:09:52.452 --> 00:09:53.952
About the mini-showroom.

00:09:54.322 --> 00:09:56.722
You want an open layout for the staff to...

00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:06.832
Let's talk when we get to the restaurant.

00:10:08.372 --> 00:10:10.342
Oh, sure.

00:10:12.642 --> 00:10:13.642
I'm starving.

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.412
Aren't you hungry?

00:10:20.852 --> 00:10:21.852
- At company dinners... - The stew is always...

00:10:22.052 --> 00:10:26.192
For the mini-showroom, how many staff tables go in the open space?

00:10:26.352 --> 00:10:30.022
And for that to happen, tell me what materials you'll display.

00:10:30.622 --> 00:10:33.962
- Oh, I got it. - Have some water first.

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:35.532
You need to take a breath.

00:10:36.362 --> 00:10:39.632
You seem so busy. Too busy to even have a meeting.

00:10:40.772 --> 00:10:44.072
Right, that's my point. We could've just chatted about this.

00:10:44.502 --> 00:10:46.912
For something under an hour in person?

00:10:48.072 --> 00:10:51.212
How do I explain the layout by text? Never mind.

00:10:51.382 --> 00:10:53.782
The mini-showroom will have a sink.

00:10:53.782 --> 00:10:55.922
Windows, flooring, wallpaper, wall molding,

00:10:55.982 --> 00:10:57.382
tiles, finishing films, bathroom fixtures...

00:10:58.022 --> 00:10:59.192
Are you going to include all of that?

00:11:01.392 --> 00:11:04.662
- Isn't it too small for all that? - Exactly.

00:11:04.822 --> 00:11:08.662
I was taking my time to figure out which materials to prioritise.

00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:11.062
But without that list,

00:11:11.162 --> 00:11:14.002
I can't even start on the mini-showroom design.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.272
- Here's your food. - Thank you.

00:11:18.402 --> 00:11:19.442
Thank you.

00:11:19.742 --> 00:11:21.212
Enjoy your meal.

00:11:21.812 --> 00:11:23.782
Let's eat first, and then we can talk. Okay?

00:11:23.912 --> 00:11:26.482
Let's talk while we eat. Since you're so busy.

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:34.622
So, why do you want an open-plan space for your team?

00:11:35.992 --> 00:11:39.092
I hate being stuck in an office all day, just working.

00:11:40.532 --> 00:11:42.502
Instead of a separate office,

00:11:42.502 --> 00:11:45.232
why not keep the current cafe layout?

00:11:45.402 --> 00:11:47.632
Come on, that'd be way too open.

00:11:48.202 --> 00:11:50.372
What positions are you hiring for?

00:11:51.242 --> 00:11:53.172
A site manager...

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:55.542
and a staff member dedicated to Mamdaerozip.

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.342
Perfect.

00:11:57.742 --> 00:12:01.182
Cheol Min is always there, right? And Mr. Jo, too.

00:12:01.282 --> 00:12:02.952
The site manager will be out a lot,

00:12:02.952 --> 00:12:05.082
and the staff member will be on the phone frequently.

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:10.492
Put six desks by the break room wall and use bookshelves as dividers.

00:12:10.562 --> 00:12:12.962
And keep the cafe layout for the rest of the space.

00:12:13.492 --> 00:12:14.692
Oh, I see.

00:12:15.062 --> 00:12:16.832
- So, basically. - Okay, let's just eat first.

00:12:16.832 --> 00:12:18.632
My noodles are getting soggy. I'm starving.

00:12:27.812 --> 00:12:29.842
Hey, slow down a little.

00:12:34.882 --> 00:12:36.222
Just listen while you eat.

00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:37.922
My point is...

00:12:38.222 --> 00:12:41.092
This way, we'll save on construction costs,

00:12:41.152 --> 00:12:43.992
and the construction timeline gets much shorter.

00:12:44.422 --> 00:12:47.562
Okay, fine! We'll do it your way. Now, let's just eat.

00:12:48.762 --> 00:12:52.102
Really? So nothing else will change, right?

00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:53.172
Yes.

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:54.872
Now, let's eat.

00:13:26.202 --> 00:13:28.742
I almost wish Seong Jae would just make his move already.

00:13:34.142 --> 00:13:36.882
(Action Plan)

00:13:38.912 --> 00:13:40.652
Is this the same Lee Ji Hyuk I know?

00:13:43.352 --> 00:13:45.322
Mamdaerozip Version 2.0...

00:13:46.822 --> 00:13:49.192
plus a comprehensive materials showroom?

00:13:51.962 --> 00:13:52.962
My gosh.

00:13:57.062 --> 00:13:59.872
Mr. Park, the buyer from Italy is here.

00:14:01.072 --> 00:14:02.142
Okay, got it.

00:14:06.942 --> 00:14:09.782
I understand that other show companies...

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:11.942
were also under consideration.

00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:17.052
Could you share the reason why our company was chosen?

00:14:24.162 --> 00:14:26.992
Because of him, Mr. Park Seong Jae.

00:14:27.892 --> 00:14:29.562
Mr. Ferrari, nice to see you again.

00:14:29.632 --> 00:14:30.632
Great to see you.

00:14:34.902 --> 00:14:36.002
Now, please...

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:45.182
The shoes are very comfortable, aren't they?

00:14:45.342 --> 00:14:48.382
They are, but...

00:14:48.452 --> 00:14:51.252
Are these all the designs you currently offer?

00:14:51.882 --> 00:14:55.562
We were expecting designs that are more unique.

00:14:55.622 --> 00:14:58.762
With more personality.

00:15:00.162 --> 00:15:04.362
Our Shoe Joy products have more strength in functionality.

00:15:05.832 --> 00:15:06.832
Okay.

00:15:15.442 --> 00:15:16.742
Have you seen everything?

00:15:17.682 --> 00:15:19.252
Yes, roughly.

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:24.682
So, you and your wife are heading to Gyeongju and Busan tomorrow, right?

00:15:25.152 --> 00:15:26.152
Yes.

00:15:26.452 --> 00:15:27.452
Here you go, sir.

00:15:36.132 --> 00:15:38.562
Provare per credere.

00:15:38.632 --> 00:15:42.302
(It's an Italian proverb meaning, "You have to try it to believe it.")

00:15:42.572 --> 00:15:44.172
When I was in the US,

00:15:44.442 --> 00:15:48.072
I had an Italian friend named Marco, and he used to say,

00:15:48.712 --> 00:15:51.042
"You have to experience it to believe it."

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:52.782
You know what I mean, right?

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:54.552
Of course, I do.

00:15:54.882 --> 00:15:57.252
Provare per credere!

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:03.222
Well... It's hard to see how great our shoes are at first...

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:05.422
just by walking around the store once,

00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:07.992
and that's why we want you to wear them...

00:16:08.062 --> 00:16:10.032
and travel in them for three days.

00:16:10.432 --> 00:16:13.502
But even after that experience,

00:16:13.502 --> 00:16:15.272
if you still think they're not right,

00:16:15.332 --> 00:16:17.672
then at least there'll be no regrets on either side.

00:16:18.342 --> 00:16:22.682
And this is the reason we're giving them to you as a gift.

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:27.582
Very well.

00:16:28.252 --> 00:16:29.282
Wait.

00:16:30.282 --> 00:16:32.222
Your wife is going with you, right?

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:34.022
Yes, she is.

00:16:34.392 --> 00:16:36.492
Do you know her shoe size?

00:16:37.392 --> 00:16:39.362
Provare per credere!

00:16:39.562 --> 00:16:42.202
We tried the shoes for four entire days...

00:16:42.262 --> 00:16:43.362
while on the trip.

00:16:43.632 --> 00:16:46.672
And they were incredibly comfortable...

00:16:46.732 --> 00:16:49.372
and light despite being leather.

00:16:49.972 --> 00:16:53.012
And my wife. She loved them even more.

00:16:54.272 --> 00:16:56.142
They even sent us pictures,

00:16:56.712 --> 00:17:00.252
saying they look great with jeans.

00:17:00.712 --> 00:17:01.752
They did?

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:06.492
I hope our product is successful in Europe as well.

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:09.722
Of course. Korean products are trusted internationally.

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:11.192
Thank you so much.

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:42.562
Then let's meet for dinner tomorrow evening.

00:17:42.622 --> 00:17:43.622
Okay.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:57.002
I'm surprised to see you escort them all the way out, Father.

00:17:58.872 --> 00:18:02.012
We've expanded into the US, India, China, and even New Zealand,

00:18:02.112 --> 00:18:04.282
but we haven't been able to crack the European market.

00:18:04.682 --> 00:18:08.682
We're entering the European market. It's the least I can do.

00:18:10.052 --> 00:18:12.352
But how did you even come up with that idea?

00:18:12.752 --> 00:18:15.722
That Italian phrase... Was it "Seeing is believing?"

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:18.862
- Hey, Director Yoon! - Yes, sir.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:21.032
The global operations team really struggled with it,

00:18:21.132 --> 00:18:23.132
but my son here nailed it in one go.

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:26.502
I know. Seriously, well done, Mr. Park.

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:28.502
Thank you.

00:18:29.102 --> 00:18:33.772
Let's celebrate at home tonight. I'll ask your mom to cook a feast.

00:18:33.942 --> 00:18:36.612
That's pretty short notice. Besides, Mom might not even be home.

00:18:37.082 --> 00:18:40.282
Dad, you're the one who always says not to bring work home.

00:18:41.152 --> 00:18:43.382
But you've done something truly exceptional.

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:45.952
I think I just got lucky on this one.

00:18:46.552 --> 00:18:50.322
And I agree with your principle of keeping work and home separate.

00:18:51.392 --> 00:18:53.092
Look at you. Such a thoughtful kid.

00:18:53.692 --> 00:18:54.762
All right.

00:19:08.112 --> 00:19:09.482
The investor wants to meet,

00:19:11.012 --> 00:19:12.282
but out on the street again?

00:19:13.512 --> 00:19:15.722
Seong Jae, when was the last time you just relaxed in the sun?

00:19:17.082 --> 00:19:19.092
I can't even remember the last time I worked out during the day.

00:19:21.052 --> 00:19:22.252
Look at this guy, so carefree.

00:19:23.222 --> 00:19:25.062
You're not even asking if I'm going to invest.

00:19:26.062 --> 00:19:27.092
Because I know you will.

00:19:28.132 --> 00:19:29.132
What?

00:19:29.202 --> 00:19:30.902
Even when you knew nothing, you joined...

00:19:30.902 --> 00:19:33.102
Sunny Investment Association to help me out.

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:36.442
Now, how could you pass after seeing my killer proposal?

00:19:37.002 --> 00:19:38.072
The only question is how much.

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:42.942
I guess we've been friends for too long.

00:19:43.212 --> 00:19:45.142
What is this? You read me like a book.

00:19:46.152 --> 00:19:47.152
Hey.

00:19:47.782 --> 00:19:49.982
I think business is in your DNA.

00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:53.222
I honestly thought you were insane when I read your proposal.

00:19:53.522 --> 00:19:55.322
Why? Did it seem too far-fetched?

00:19:55.722 --> 00:19:56.762
No, that's not it.

00:19:57.192 --> 00:19:59.292
The speed of your expansion in the same sector.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.062
Most people would struggle...

00:20:01.062 --> 00:20:03.062
with Mamdaerozip's current growth rate.

00:20:03.332 --> 00:20:04.932
They'd be overwhelmed and just grateful for it.

00:20:05.732 --> 00:20:06.732
You think so?

00:20:07.232 --> 00:20:10.402
Did you really not know what you were made of?

00:20:11.402 --> 00:20:12.442
What do you mean?

00:20:14.542 --> 00:20:16.942
You were born with an entrepreneur's DNA.

00:20:17.712 --> 00:20:19.552
Why did it take you so long to discover that?

00:20:20.682 --> 00:20:25.382
I guess I never had the chance. Anyway, how much will you invest?

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:27.892
Two million dollars.

00:20:29.022 --> 00:20:30.022
Two million dollars?

00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:33.892
I set that aside because I thought you were just expanding Mamdaerozip.

00:20:34.492 --> 00:20:36.362
But you're also planning a full-scale exhibition center.

00:20:37.432 --> 00:20:39.102
I'm more than grateful for two million dollars.

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:41.672
I'll raise the rest myself.

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:44.672
I'm so incredibly proud.

00:20:45.442 --> 00:20:46.872
Your parents must be over the moon.

00:20:48.842 --> 00:20:50.942
I haven't told them what my business is yet.

00:20:52.812 --> 00:20:53.852
What? Why not?

00:20:55.112 --> 00:20:56.252
It's a funny thing.

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:59.322
I have no problem asking complete strangers to invest in me,

00:20:59.392 --> 00:21:02.052
and I had no problem being brazen with Ji Eun Oh,

00:21:02.692 --> 00:21:04.062
but for some reason, it's not easy with my parents.

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:05.722
Especially my father.

00:21:06.662 --> 00:21:08.262
He still doesn't believe in me.

00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:12.302
So when are you going to tell them?

00:21:13.302 --> 00:21:14.332
Once it's a sure thing.

00:21:15.532 --> 00:21:17.772
Because I chose to marry Jung Bo A back then,

00:21:18.172 --> 00:21:20.342
he still treats me like a pathetic loser.

00:21:21.512 --> 00:21:23.512
He's still mad about it. My father.

00:21:26.212 --> 00:21:28.912
Your dad's still mad?

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:32.322
What? You think I deserve to be treated like that?

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:35.022
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

00:21:35.452 --> 00:21:37.022
I've really done a lot of self-reflection.

00:21:38.192 --> 00:21:40.892
After we got into that fight, I thought about it.

00:21:41.732 --> 00:21:43.862
I realised my own feelings were dictating how I treated you.

00:21:44.762 --> 00:21:46.072
Regardless of the facts,

00:21:46.402 --> 00:21:49.442
you must have been the one who was suffering the most.

00:21:50.702 --> 00:21:53.512
Like you said, my emotions got the better of me.

00:21:55.642 --> 00:21:57.482
That's exactly what my father's doing now.

00:22:00.182 --> 00:22:01.382
Man, if it's that bad,

00:22:02.452 --> 00:22:03.952
you two really need to have a heart-to-heart.

00:22:05.222 --> 00:22:07.852
But if it's that awkward, why'd you move back home?

00:22:08.292 --> 00:22:09.622
Because the last time I left, I basically ran away.

00:22:10.292 --> 00:22:12.832
But it's not just my father. My mom and grandma are there too.

00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:16.162
I'll move out when I can stand on my own two feet.

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:18.432
And I'll tell them about the business once it's on track.

00:22:19.402 --> 00:22:20.772
I can't let them down again.

00:22:22.772 --> 00:22:25.302
Man, family's a funny thing.

00:22:26.142 --> 00:22:30.012
To me, your parents were the parents I always wished I had.

00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:32.912
This really isn't right.

00:22:33.812 --> 00:22:36.522
- You little punk! - Listen to us, will you?

00:22:37.852 --> 00:22:38.882
Hey!

00:22:39.592 --> 00:22:42.122
Isn't making him your gopher enough? He bought you sneakers,

00:22:42.122 --> 00:22:44.292
and you even steal his allowance every Monday.

00:22:46.132 --> 00:22:48.462
Lee Ji Hyuk. You'd better not regret this.

00:22:48.532 --> 00:22:49.532
I'll crush you to dust.

00:22:49.602 --> 00:22:52.462
If you lose to me, you'll leave Park Seong Jae alone.

00:22:53.072 --> 00:22:54.132
Go easy on him.

00:23:08.482 --> 00:23:10.022
- Hey. - You all saw that, right?

00:23:11.182 --> 00:23:12.852
From now on, none of you can mess with Park Seong Jae.

00:23:14.692 --> 00:23:15.722
Hey!

00:23:16.292 --> 00:23:17.322
Hey!

00:23:18.692 --> 00:23:19.692
Ji Hyuk!

00:23:22.332 --> 00:23:23.902
My gosh, Ji Hyuk.

00:23:26.602 --> 00:23:29.102
Ji Hyuk, shouldn't you go to the hospital?

00:23:29.402 --> 00:23:31.342
It's not that bad. I just got banged up a little.

00:23:32.042 --> 00:23:33.812
This is more than a little.

00:23:34.912 --> 00:23:37.742
She didn't even ask what happened. She was just worried about you.

00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:39.082
Your mom.

00:23:40.012 --> 00:23:43.582
Where did you go and who did you fight with...

00:23:44.082 --> 00:23:45.822
to end up like this?

00:23:47.622 --> 00:23:48.852
Ji Hyuk...

00:23:49.392 --> 00:23:51.792
- stepped in for me and... - I got into it with some bullies.

00:23:52.662 --> 00:23:53.692
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:23:54.962 --> 00:23:56.532
How did this happen?

00:23:56.962 --> 00:23:59.432
It's the usual story. Some bullies were picking a fight.

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.332
You didn't just take it, did you?

00:24:02.802 --> 00:24:03.802
Of course not.

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:06.412
Right, Seong Jae? I landed some good hits, didn't I?

00:24:10.542 --> 00:24:11.782
Your name's Seong Jae, right?

00:24:12.382 --> 00:24:14.882
It must've been tough getting Ji Hyuk home.

00:24:18.652 --> 00:24:19.652
You must be hungry.

00:24:21.052 --> 00:24:23.722
I thought your mom was going to chew me out too.

00:24:24.222 --> 00:24:26.432
But instead, she just said "You must be hungry."

00:24:27.062 --> 00:24:28.462
And don't even get me started on your dad.

00:24:30.362 --> 00:24:31.562
Eat up, you two.

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:35.002
Ji Hyuk!

00:24:35.502 --> 00:24:38.372
- Hey! Ji Hyuk, son. - Dad.

00:24:38.702 --> 00:24:40.242
- Hello, sir. - Yes, hi.

00:24:40.242 --> 00:24:41.612
Look at the state of his face.

00:24:41.672 --> 00:24:43.042
- Hey, get up. Let me see. - Okay.

00:24:43.542 --> 00:24:46.012
Hey, where are you hurt?

00:24:46.082 --> 00:24:47.252
Where does it hurt? Are you okay?

00:24:47.812 --> 00:24:51.352
Dad. Of course, it hurts. My knee's scraped.

00:24:51.422 --> 00:24:54.952
Hey, I'm just checking if you cracked or broke a bone.

00:24:54.952 --> 00:24:57.892
I already checked him over. No broken bones.

00:24:57.962 --> 00:24:59.692
It's just bruises, but they're pretty bad.

00:24:59.732 --> 00:25:01.392
My boy, how did this even...

00:25:01.762 --> 00:25:04.462
Are you getting bullied at school or something?

00:25:05.702 --> 00:25:07.372
It's my fault.

00:25:08.172 --> 00:25:11.202
He was defending me from some kids and ended up fighting them for me.

00:25:11.972 --> 00:25:13.472
Ji Hyuk fought them for me.

00:25:14.212 --> 00:25:15.312
I'm sorry, sir.

00:25:15.312 --> 00:25:17.612
- Hey, kid! What are you sorry for? - What do you have to be sorry for?

00:25:18.612 --> 00:25:19.952
Don't be.

00:25:20.482 --> 00:25:23.152
Come on, sit down. Let's eat. Sit down.

00:25:23.982 --> 00:25:25.322
That's when I was completely won over.

00:25:25.322 --> 00:25:27.422
By your parents.

00:25:27.952 --> 00:25:29.992
You got hurt because of me,

00:25:29.992 --> 00:25:31.322
and I didn't have a scratch on me.

00:25:31.862 --> 00:25:34.062
I was sure I'd get scolded, but they said,

00:25:34.192 --> 00:25:36.632
"The ones who picked the fight are the ones to blame."

00:25:37.132 --> 00:25:40.532
They said I did nothing wrong and that you did the right thing.

00:25:41.402 --> 00:25:43.202
They're really warm people.

00:25:44.572 --> 00:25:46.972
That was the best meal I've ever had in my life.

00:25:47.442 --> 00:25:49.882
After that, you were practically living at my house.

00:25:50.642 --> 00:25:52.182
I envied you for having a father like that.

00:25:52.482 --> 00:25:53.982
"Are you hurt anywhere?"

00:25:55.412 --> 00:25:58.182
I'd never had anyone ask me that before.

00:25:59.052 --> 00:26:01.622
That's the price of being born a third-generation rich heir.

00:26:01.992 --> 00:26:05.492
He probably raised you tough so you could run the company, right?

00:26:06.262 --> 00:26:07.262
Hey.

00:26:07.862 --> 00:26:10.332
You're so understanding when it comes to my dad,

00:26:10.662 --> 00:26:12.872
so why are you so hard on your own dad?

00:26:13.732 --> 00:26:15.072
Maybe it's because he's my father.

00:26:16.272 --> 00:26:17.272
What?

00:26:18.242 --> 00:26:21.272
It's a relationship tangled up in expectations and obligations.

00:26:25.282 --> 00:26:26.612
I get what you mean.

00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:30.152
That makes sense.

00:26:39.592 --> 00:26:41.892
It's our first date, and we're at a place like this.

00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:44.262
And I even made us a reservation at a fancy steakhouse.

00:26:44.432 --> 00:26:47.702
You bought me a beer last time. It's my turn to treat you.

00:26:49.472 --> 00:26:50.972
You're so frugal, Su Bin.

00:26:51.442 --> 00:26:55.442
For most working people, I'd say a place like this is normal.

00:26:55.872 --> 00:26:59.612
No. It's different if a girl is dating me.

00:27:02.052 --> 00:27:04.582
Besides, I'm planning to quit my job.

00:27:04.582 --> 00:27:08.392
You know about my YouTube channel. I really enjoy it,

00:27:08.452 --> 00:27:11.122
but growth was slow, so I got a job.

00:27:11.122 --> 00:27:12.592
But it's not really a good fit,

00:27:12.662 --> 00:27:14.732
so I'm just going to focus on growing my channel.

00:27:15.632 --> 00:27:17.102
What do you think?

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:24.002
What's there to think about? If you enjoy it, you should do it.

00:27:28.712 --> 00:27:30.782
Did you think I wouldn't support you?

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:35.052
Really? I thought you wanted a career woman.

00:27:35.312 --> 00:27:36.822
Well, I saw you had a job.

00:27:39.952 --> 00:27:41.352
So when are you quitting?

00:27:41.452 --> 00:27:43.692
I have to stay until they find my replacement.

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:46.192
Why would you wait for that? Just put in your notice tomorrow.

00:27:46.262 --> 00:27:47.592
That way, we can go have fun together.

00:27:47.662 --> 00:27:50.332
No, I can't do that. I have to train my replacement.

00:27:50.632 --> 00:27:51.902
Train a replacement? Why?

00:27:51.902 --> 00:27:53.302
It's not like they're designer goods.

00:27:53.602 --> 00:27:55.272
How can you talk like that?

00:27:55.502 --> 00:27:58.802
In some ways, their shoes are better than any designer brand.

00:27:59.242 --> 00:28:02.242
Okay, I get it. But about your channel's content...

00:28:02.512 --> 00:28:06.452
You should switch to luxury goods. Luxury unboxings get tons of views.

00:28:06.782 --> 00:28:08.082
Ditch cheap clothes for designer wear.

00:28:08.082 --> 00:28:09.652
I'll buy it all for you.

00:28:10.282 --> 00:28:13.892
Why would I change my content to luxury unboxing videos?

00:28:14.222 --> 00:28:16.262
It's an upgrade, obviously. Anyone can see that.

00:28:16.322 --> 00:28:20.232
An upgrade? Should you judge a job so casually?

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:23.762
By that logic, doesn't your company just sell puffed rice?

00:28:23.932 --> 00:28:27.972
Our product might be puffed rice, but it's Byeolnara Confectionery.

00:28:28.872 --> 00:28:30.542
And I am the heir to that company, little one.

00:28:31.802 --> 00:28:35.072
That too. Why do you keep calling me that,

00:28:35.072 --> 00:28:36.242
as if you're my brother or something?

00:28:36.382 --> 00:28:39.382
I only have three brothers, you see.

00:28:39.882 --> 00:28:41.282
Right, and you have two older brothers.

00:28:41.352 --> 00:28:43.382
And there's one other guy who's like a brother to me.

00:28:43.622 --> 00:28:46.592
The only men who get to act like brothers to me...

00:28:46.652 --> 00:28:48.722
are those three.

00:28:49.092 --> 00:28:52.122
What are you talking about? If we date, I'm number one.

00:28:52.222 --> 00:28:56.562
Only call me and your brothers that. As for that other guy?

00:28:56.702 --> 00:28:59.432
Absolutely not. I'm the one who gets to be number one.

00:28:59.502 --> 00:29:01.472
I'm number one. I absolutely won't stand for it.

00:29:02.402 --> 00:29:04.472
And what are you going to do about it?

00:29:04.772 --> 00:29:05.772
What?

00:29:05.842 --> 00:29:09.812
There's absolutely no way I'm ever going to call you that.

00:29:10.312 --> 00:29:11.542
Because I'm not going to date you.

00:29:18.922 --> 00:29:21.252
Lee Su Bin! If you leave like this, we are done!

00:29:36.542 --> 00:29:38.072
What was I thinking?

00:29:38.842 --> 00:29:40.472
Was I possessed or something?

00:29:40.812 --> 00:29:44.112
Why would I dump a guy who's so rich, handsome, and young?

00:29:44.212 --> 00:29:45.942
Why did I dump him?

00:29:47.412 --> 00:29:50.582
He's so arrogant and pretentious. That's why I dumped him.

00:29:51.722 --> 00:29:54.952
But even so, he was such a great catch.

00:29:55.092 --> 00:29:56.522
And he really liked me.

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:59.632
This is driving me crazy.

00:30:09.302 --> 00:30:11.942
- Da Jeong, all finished? - Yes.

00:30:12.002 --> 00:30:14.012
Thank you so much for working late.

00:30:14.272 --> 00:30:17.042
Here, I marinated some spicy pork. Have this for dinner.

00:30:17.112 --> 00:30:18.212
I put in some green onion kimchi too.

00:30:18.742 --> 00:30:22.412
- No, that's really okay, ma'am. - It'll be too late to cook.

00:30:22.512 --> 00:30:23.752
Go on, take it.

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:25.022
Go on home.

00:30:27.692 --> 00:30:29.252
I should give this to Dad.

00:30:40.332 --> 00:30:42.932
Da Jeong. Hey, you didn't even call?

00:30:43.002 --> 00:30:45.472
Dad, I can't stay long. I have to go make dinner for Mother.

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:48.272
Here's some spicy pork stir-fry. Just heat it up for dinner.

00:30:48.842 --> 00:30:51.182
- I have to go! - Okay.

00:31:02.752 --> 00:31:05.892
The phone is turned off. Connecting to voicemail...

00:31:06.262 --> 00:31:08.362
(Father-in-law)

00:31:08.462 --> 00:31:09.702
Why is his phone off?

00:31:15.532 --> 00:31:17.072
Father.

00:31:17.802 --> 00:31:18.942
Father.

00:31:20.542 --> 00:31:22.542
Is he not home at this hour?

00:31:23.642 --> 00:31:24.642
Father.

00:31:27.812 --> 00:31:29.582
Father!

00:31:29.852 --> 00:31:31.052
Father.

00:31:31.922 --> 00:31:34.052
Oh, my. Sang Cheol.

00:31:36.662 --> 00:31:37.662
Father...

00:31:40.492 --> 00:31:43.602
Why are you just sitting here in the dark?

00:31:44.662 --> 00:31:45.702
Oh, well...

00:31:46.062 --> 00:31:47.872
I must have dozed off.

00:31:49.472 --> 00:31:50.872
What's this?

00:31:51.372 --> 00:31:54.712
That's some food Da Jeong dropped off earlier.

00:31:55.212 --> 00:31:58.112
Goodness. She should have put it in the fridge.

00:31:58.182 --> 00:31:59.342
Oh, no.

00:31:59.812 --> 00:32:02.212
I told her I'd put it away myself.

00:32:20.572 --> 00:32:23.272
- That's enough. Let's eat. - Yes. Okay.

00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:30.512
I'm sorry I can't visit more often. You must get lonely.

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:34.782
A well-fed man shouldn't complain. I'm luckier than most.

00:32:38.352 --> 00:32:41.292
You're the one who must be worried sick.

00:32:41.352 --> 00:32:43.462
So why are you looking after me on top of everything?

00:32:43.562 --> 00:32:46.832
Please, don't worry about me. I'm taking it one step at a time.

00:32:48.532 --> 00:32:50.232
Don't you worry about me either.

00:32:50.862 --> 00:32:52.962
Da Jeong brings me side dishes...

00:32:53.372 --> 00:32:57.142
and stocks the freezer with rice, and there's always something on TV.

00:32:57.572 --> 00:33:01.042
And when I go to the Senior Center, there are plenty of chess partners.

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:03.112
That's a huge relief.

00:33:03.942 --> 00:33:05.782
- Please, help yourself. - You too. Eat up.

00:33:05.842 --> 00:33:06.852
I will.

00:33:13.452 --> 00:33:14.452
Here.

00:33:15.752 --> 00:33:17.392
Why are you trying to give this to me again?

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:22.632
What do you mean, "again?" You had the wrong idea about me.

00:33:22.692 --> 00:33:24.262
Isn't that why you turned it down?

00:33:25.562 --> 00:33:27.672
You said your projects might overlap.

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:29.572
Buy a car before that happens.

00:33:30.542 --> 00:33:33.472
Gosh, I worry so much about you coming home late.

00:33:33.542 --> 00:33:37.482
It breaks my heart to think of you catching buses and subways.

00:33:38.482 --> 00:33:41.282
But I've almost saved up enough on my own.

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:47.152
I'll be so hurt if you refuse again.

00:33:48.222 --> 00:33:50.092
You said you weren't getting married anytime soon.

00:33:55.292 --> 00:33:56.632
All right.

00:33:57.062 --> 00:33:58.062
But...

00:33:58.432 --> 00:34:00.802
when I get married, I'll pay for everything myself.

00:34:03.372 --> 00:34:05.302
So you do plan on getting married someday.

00:34:07.012 --> 00:34:08.572
If the right person comes along, sure.

00:34:09.012 --> 00:34:10.812
I told you. I'm not against the idea of marriage.

00:34:43.712 --> 00:34:44.742
Man...

00:35:08.432 --> 00:35:09.432
Ji Gang Oh.

00:35:11.272 --> 00:35:12.542
Oh, hey.

00:35:13.042 --> 00:35:15.712
I was just passing by and thought I'd see how business is going.

00:35:16.212 --> 00:35:18.212
Hey, perfect timing, man.

00:35:19.082 --> 00:35:21.012
Man, this world is so unfair.

00:35:22.112 --> 00:35:23.582
I'm telling you, looks really do matter.

00:35:24.552 --> 00:35:26.722
You have a lot of female regulars asking for you.

00:35:27.852 --> 00:35:28.852
Really?

00:35:29.892 --> 00:35:30.892
Of course, they're looking for me.

00:35:32.292 --> 00:35:34.732
Go in and get some sleep. You start work tomorrow.

00:35:44.202 --> 00:35:46.202
Yeong Ra, it's here!

00:35:49.742 --> 00:35:50.742
Hey.

00:35:53.782 --> 00:35:54.852
Hey!

00:35:55.452 --> 00:35:57.052
Stop reading, and let's eat.

00:35:57.852 --> 00:35:58.852
Here you go.

00:36:07.992 --> 00:36:08.992
That's tteokbokki.

00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:13.102
Yes. Tteokbokki and frozen yogurt are a killer combo.

00:36:18.802 --> 00:36:19.802
Oh, no.

00:36:26.542 --> 00:36:27.552
This is what I work for.

00:36:29.712 --> 00:36:31.052
You're not even going to offer me any?

00:36:32.822 --> 00:36:36.022
I always offer, but you said you were dieting for the exhibition.

00:36:51.202 --> 00:36:52.202
Here.

00:36:52.442 --> 00:36:53.442
Just have one.

00:36:57.142 --> 00:36:59.142
You can't just give me one without asking!

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:18.102
You need to finish all of this today to keep drawing "Take My Heart."

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:19.732
You'd better keep your promise!

00:37:24.272 --> 00:37:25.272
Look at you.

00:37:26.402 --> 00:37:28.842
- You said it was better with this. - Yes.

00:37:28.912 --> 00:37:29.912
Okay.

00:37:34.182 --> 00:37:35.182
Delicious, right?

00:37:40.052 --> 00:37:42.252
Well... That one was mine.

00:37:50.932 --> 00:37:51.962
That tastes awful.

00:37:53.572 --> 00:37:54.632
It does.

00:38:00.872 --> 00:38:03.882
I think this piece should be the main feature.

00:38:04.442 --> 00:38:06.582
But of course, the final decision is up to the two of you.

00:38:07.512 --> 00:38:09.452
When it comes to placement, we should defer to your judgment.

00:38:11.452 --> 00:38:12.952
But the lighting...

00:38:13.182 --> 00:38:16.622
Isn't it a little over-the-top for the size of Yeong Ra's painting?

00:38:17.822 --> 00:38:20.592
We'll adjust the focus before installing the artwork.

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:25.832
What's your take on it, Curator?

00:38:27.102 --> 00:38:31.402
The important thing is which piece complements Yeong Ra's work.

00:38:32.342 --> 00:38:36.612
Dokgo Chan goes to a Busan orphanage by himself to save his sister.

00:38:37.412 --> 00:38:38.412
Leaving So Ri behind?

00:38:39.082 --> 00:38:43.212
Why? He's already in love with So Ri.

00:38:43.352 --> 00:38:46.752
His sister La Ni is hiding in Mr. Pink's basement,

00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:48.892
and her food and water should have run out by now.

00:38:49.492 --> 00:38:51.092
And the door is locked from the outside.

00:38:51.522 --> 00:38:54.132
So what happens to So Ri?

00:38:55.392 --> 00:38:56.392
I don't know.

00:38:57.902 --> 00:39:01.472
I have to write what happens to So Ri while Chan is in Busan.

00:39:04.202 --> 00:39:06.942
You should put So Ri in some kind of huge crisis.

00:39:07.412 --> 00:39:09.672
Something like, "She's a goner. Jin Woo will kill her."

00:39:10.312 --> 00:39:12.212
Oh, good idea.

00:39:19.452 --> 00:39:22.892
(The cafe is closing down.)

00:39:24.892 --> 00:39:25.892
This feels so weird.

00:39:26.962 --> 00:39:29.432
We need to figure out what to do with the cafe equipment, and fast.

00:39:29.932 --> 00:39:32.732
No, wait. Let's check what we can reuse first.

00:39:33.132 --> 00:39:34.932
You're going to use old stuff in the new space?

00:39:35.772 --> 00:39:38.872
We have to reuse what we can. Ji Hyuk doesn't have a lot of money.

00:39:42.712 --> 00:39:43.712
Ji Hyuk!

00:39:43.782 --> 00:39:46.312
(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

00:39:46.512 --> 00:39:47.652
So you put up the closing notice.

00:39:58.922 --> 00:40:01.292
We can put a sink in the showroom on the terrace...

00:40:01.492 --> 00:40:04.562
so visiting clients can have coffee while they browse materials.

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:06.762
Let's turn it into a drink station. That's the idea.

00:40:07.702 --> 00:40:08.702
I like it.

00:40:10.102 --> 00:40:13.712
- I like it. - You do? So, should we finalize it?

00:40:14.312 --> 00:40:16.112
Let's just take one more look at it in 3D.

00:40:16.442 --> 00:40:19.182
Okay, I'll make the 3D model with furniture,

00:40:19.182 --> 00:40:21.082
lighting, and power outlets.

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:22.752
I'll have it all finished and sent to you by tonight.

00:40:26.052 --> 00:40:28.252
Working right through dinner. You two are something else.

00:40:29.852 --> 00:40:31.492
I'm heading out for the night.

00:40:31.892 --> 00:40:32.892
Yes, go ahead.

00:40:34.862 --> 00:40:37.262
Wow, I didn't realise it was so late.

00:40:38.702 --> 00:40:40.902
I guess you can have your coffee and pastry in the car.

00:40:42.272 --> 00:40:46.202
Actually, I have to pull an all-nighter in the storeroom.

00:40:46.842 --> 00:40:48.712
What? I have to work all night too.

00:40:49.212 --> 00:40:51.612
I've got that client meeting for Art Space tomorrow.

00:40:52.382 --> 00:40:53.382
Oh, no. What do we do?

00:40:54.112 --> 00:40:58.352
Cheol Min's at the office all night for the website restoration,

00:40:58.422 --> 00:40:59.682
so I can't work there tonight.

00:41:00.022 --> 00:41:02.092
I was just letting you know that I have to work all night too.

00:41:02.652 --> 00:41:03.662
Is anyone stopping you?

00:41:11.002 --> 00:41:12.332
Right.

00:41:17.172 --> 00:41:19.702
"did I ever predict this kind of explosive growth?"

00:41:20.202 --> 00:41:23.072
"Absolutely not. But I knew it would be a hit."

00:41:23.682 --> 00:41:26.242
"But on second thought,"

00:41:26.342 --> 00:41:28.452
"maybe I knew all along."

Mr. Lee!

My gosh.

00:43:57.702 --> 00:43:58.702
He's burning up.

00:43:59.432 --> 00:44:00.732
Gosh, what do I do?

00:44:01.202 --> 00:44:02.202

Mr. Lee, stay with me. Are you okay?

00:44:24.062 --> 00:44:27.262
Okay, lean on me for a second. Hold on!

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:29.062
Hang on a second!

00:44:31.732 --> 00:44:33.932
Okay, duck your head. Watch your head!

00:44:34.302 --> 00:44:35.332
There you go.

Why are your legs so long? My gosh.

Just wait here a second.

My gosh...

00:44:59.922 --> 00:45:01.292
There are no cars around.

00:45:01.762 --> 00:45:02.762
I can handle this.

- How do you know the patient? - Excuse me?

He's my senior colleague.

00:45:29.422 --> 00:45:34.232
His inflammatory markers are high, and his lymphocyte count is low.

00:45:34.692 --> 00:45:37.502
It looks like a viral infection from a weakened immune system...

00:45:37.502 --> 00:45:38.862
due to stress and overwork.

00:45:40.632 --> 00:45:41.672
Is it serious?

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:44.502
No. There are no other complications,

00:45:44.642 --> 00:45:45.872
so he'll be fine with some IV fluids and rest.

00:45:46.472 --> 00:45:49.312

Give them to me. I'll drive.

00:51:04.692 --> 00:51:07.322
Since when am I just all talk?

00:51:17.302 --> 00:51:19.142
Give me some more fish.

00:51:40.322 --> 00:51:41.932
Look, I told you to go home.

00:51:42.492 --> 00:51:43.662
You pulled an all-nighter.

00:51:44.132 --> 00:51:45.602
Go home, get some rest, and then come back.

00:51:47.132 --> 00:51:49.032
You're the one who should go home and rest.

00:51:49.332 --> 00:51:50.942
The doctor said you needed plenty of rest.

00:52:09.892 --> 00:52:11.922
I told you. I can take care of myself.

00:52:13.362 --> 00:52:15.662
- I know. - Why did you follow me in here?

00:52:16.092 --> 00:52:17.492
You're not going home?

00:52:18.132 --> 00:52:19.532
I have my IR presentation today.

00:52:19.632 --> 00:52:20.662
(IR: Investment relations presentation)

00:52:29.372 --> 00:52:31.812
Is everything ready for it? What time's the pitch?

00:52:33.282 --> 00:52:34.282
I've got plenty of time.

00:52:35.382 --> 00:52:37.012
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:39.822
Don't help me.

00:52:41.292 --> 00:52:42.822
Don't even think about it.

00:52:46.492 --> 00:52:47.492
Eun Oh.

00:52:49.562 --> 00:52:50.662
Stop being so nice to me.

00:52:54.332 --> 00:52:55.502
Don't confuse me.

00:53:01.842 --> 00:53:02.842
What was that?

00:53:04.242 --> 00:53:05.482
I just can't figure him out.

00:53:10.052 --> 00:53:13.252
Oh, I was just about to call you.

00:53:13.552 --> 00:53:14.992
I saw your suit was still here.

00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:16.822
That's what I'm here for.

00:53:17.862 --> 00:53:18.922
Where are you off to?

00:53:20.192 --> 00:53:22.232
To the spa to shower.

00:53:23.092 --> 00:53:26.562
Exactly. I worried you'd leave in your current state.

00:53:28.072 --> 00:53:29.072
I'll be back.

00:53:34.512 --> 00:53:35.772
Man, he looks terrible.

00:53:36.872 --> 00:53:38.012
It must be from pulling an all-nighter.

00:53:41.282 --> 00:53:42.582
As you may have seen from our IR materials,

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:46.282
the growth rate of Mamdaerozip speaks for itself.

00:53:46.822 --> 00:53:49.392
Over 60,000 cumulative app downloads.

00:53:49.752 --> 00:53:52.122
An 11-fold increase in daily website traffic.

00:53:52.592 --> 00:53:54.932
And a contract conversion rate of 93.4 percent.

00:53:55.562 --> 00:53:59.432
Recording a 400 percent growth rate in just the 1st quarter,

00:53:59.702 --> 00:54:00.832
we now find ourselves...

00:54:01.102 --> 00:54:03.502
in need of Version 2.0, and sooner than we ever anticipated.

00:54:04.542 --> 00:54:05.542
(Mamdaerozip 2.0)

00:54:05.602 --> 00:54:06.972
(Why a comprehensive materials showroom?)

00:54:07.202 --> 00:54:10.612
As you can see, consumers have more options than ever before.

00:54:10.842 --> 00:54:13.982
But that doesn't necessarily work in their favour.

00:54:14.042 --> 00:54:16.652
It means more time and energy spent on making a decision.

00:54:19.752 --> 00:54:20.882
That's why what's important...

00:54:21.592 --> 00:54:23.052
isn't the range of options,

00:54:23.392 --> 00:54:25.862
but rather, a discerning eye.

00:54:26.222 --> 00:54:29.832
We're not just showcasing materials. We're showcasing personality.

00:54:30.532 --> 00:54:34.262
That's the kind of showroom we're aiming for.

00:54:34.532 --> 00:54:35.532
Thank you.

00:54:35.532 --> 00:54:36.572
(Showcasing personality, not materials)

00:54:37.872 --> 00:54:39.172
(Thank you for your attention.)

00:54:46.042 --> 00:54:47.182
I wonder if Seong Jae was right.

00:54:47.782 --> 00:54:49.382
I don't feel tired at all.

00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:00.922
I guess having separate break areas was too much to ask.

00:55:01.262 --> 00:55:02.592
It looks so cramped.

00:55:03.792 --> 00:55:05.232
I should've listened to you.

00:55:05.532 --> 00:55:06.762
I got too ahead of myself.

00:55:07.662 --> 00:55:09.672
No, it's fine. We can just fix it.

00:55:10.102 --> 00:55:12.302
We revise apartment blueprints a dozen times sometimes.

00:55:12.872 --> 00:55:14.942
- Really? - Yes.

00:55:17.342 --> 00:55:18.342
Oh, my.

00:55:18.742 --> 00:55:19.742
What is that?

00:55:23.182 --> 00:55:24.182
My gosh.

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:29.122
Looks like there's a leak here. It wasn't here before.

00:55:31.022 --> 00:55:32.022
Looks like it.

00:55:32.492 --> 00:55:34.262
It must have leaked during that last downpour.

00:55:36.792 --> 00:55:39.332
I thought I was done with leaks in my life.

00:55:43.732 --> 00:55:46.742
Your room's never been flooded, has it?

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:49.512
No.

00:55:52.112 --> 00:55:53.912
When I was a sophomore in high school,

00:55:54.782 --> 00:55:56.012
I dropped out.

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:02.122
My father would start drinking soju first thing in the morning.

00:56:03.422 --> 00:56:05.722
He made a habit of beating my mom.

00:56:07.392 --> 00:56:10.162
One day, he hit her over the head with an empty bottle.

00:56:10.692 --> 00:56:14.732
She was bleeding, so to save her, we fled to the mainland.

00:56:15.502 --> 00:56:19.002
It was the start of summer vacation during my sophomore year.

00:56:20.502 --> 00:56:21.972
I'm originally from Jeju Island.

00:56:26.012 --> 00:56:29.312
I used the money I'd saved up from a part-time job for college...

00:56:29.712 --> 00:56:32.952
to rent a semi-basement room in Myeongri-dong, Seoul.

00:56:33.622 --> 00:56:35.322
But it rained so much that year.

00:56:36.522 --> 00:56:40.162
And then suddenly, the water just started pouring in.

00:56:40.862 --> 00:56:42.432
It came all the way up to my knees.

00:56:43.392 --> 00:56:47.032
I had to bail out all the water and clean the entire place.

00:56:48.272 --> 00:56:51.442
We were desperate to leave the room filled with black mold.

00:56:53.272 --> 00:56:55.872
My mom and I, we did every odd job you can imagine.

00:57:00.682 --> 00:57:02.512
I don't look like someone who's been through all that, do I?

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:06.822
You see,

00:57:07.422 --> 00:57:11.262
I got out of that basement room, but I couldn't climb any higher.

00:57:13.592 --> 00:57:17.462
I got my GED and wanted to go to art school,

00:57:18.462 --> 00:57:20.902
but my mom was sick for a few years, and then she passed away.

00:57:23.402 --> 00:57:25.702
I was working at a small company,

00:57:26.402 --> 00:57:28.472
and that's where I met the man I fell in love with.

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:30.912
We had beautiful children together.

00:57:34.342 --> 00:57:35.552
But then my husband...

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:38.482
And just like that, he was killed in a hit-and-run.

00:57:41.222 --> 00:57:42.222
My goodness.

00:57:44.592 --> 00:57:46.722
I was left alone with the children.

00:57:48.132 --> 00:57:51.432
At our new place, the ceiling and walls leaked...

00:57:52.832 --> 00:57:54.402
every time it rained.

00:57:57.672 --> 00:57:58.972
That water stain...

00:57:59.572 --> 00:58:02.642
It looked like a banana to my kids.

00:58:06.142 --> 00:58:07.312
So whenever it rained,

00:58:08.082 --> 00:58:09.952
they'd ask me to buy them bananas.

00:58:14.222 --> 00:58:16.352
My daughter, especially.

00:58:21.562 --> 00:58:23.392
Bananas were her absolute favourite.

00:58:29.432 --> 00:58:30.572
I had no idea.

00:58:33.772 --> 00:58:35.912
Seeing a leak for the first time in decades...

00:58:36.572 --> 00:58:37.912
It's amazing how vivid the memory is,

00:58:37.912 --> 00:58:39.042
as if it were yesterday.

00:58:41.812 --> 00:58:44.452
Of course, you wouldn't forget something like that.

00:58:46.622 --> 00:58:47.682
But still, Director Ko...

00:58:48.922 --> 00:58:50.622
You're truly incredible.

00:58:53.492 --> 00:58:54.562
How so?

00:58:55.692 --> 00:58:57.592
You've overcome all of that hardship.

00:58:58.402 --> 00:59:02.472
Now, you're running scholarships and even sponsoring artists.

00:59:05.642 --> 00:59:09.572
When you've struggled yourself, you can't help but see it in others.

00:59:11.142 --> 00:59:14.882
The arts are a path I couldn't take, so I have a soft spot for them.

00:59:17.212 --> 00:59:18.622
In that respect,

00:59:19.082 --> 00:59:21.252
I think you're the one who's more impressive, Eun Oh.

00:59:22.922 --> 00:59:24.792
You're doing what you love.

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:28.022
You've even set your mother up so she's taken care of.

00:59:28.662 --> 00:59:31.402
And quitting a great company like Doogle...

00:59:31.762 --> 00:59:33.632
That's not something just anyone can do.

00:59:36.702 --> 00:59:38.272
Well, when you put it that way,

00:59:38.972 --> 00:59:41.142
you make me feel like I'm really someone special.

00:59:45.712 --> 00:59:47.042
Anyway, I have no idea why today...

00:59:47.612 --> 00:59:52.052
I just bared my soul about my past. All because of that water stain.

00:59:53.182 --> 00:59:54.182
That's...

00:59:55.022 --> 00:59:58.862
because I'm not involved with anyone in your life.

01:00:01.292 --> 01:00:02.292
What?

01:00:03.162 --> 01:00:06.202
It makes it easier to talk freely, you see.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:11.742
It's like talking to a priest, or getting therapy.

01:00:13.342 --> 01:00:14.342
After all,

01:00:14.972 --> 01:00:17.672
I told you all about my brother, didn't I?

01:00:22.882 --> 01:00:24.712
You know, you're right.

01:00:33.392 --> 01:00:36.492
Director Ko is incredible. She's overcome so much.

01:00:38.062 --> 01:00:40.132
You'd never guess she'd had it so rough.

01:00:41.002 --> 01:00:42.272
Coming from that background...

01:00:43.202 --> 01:00:44.732
I want to be just like her.

01:00:46.002 --> 01:00:48.312
(Jaeha Park, Bus Stop)

01:01:06.122 --> 01:01:07.162
Is that Woo Jin?

01:01:08.022 --> 01:01:10.762
Han Woo Jin. What's he doing here in Korea?

01:01:12.832 --> 01:01:16.072
- The number you have dialled... - Right.

01:01:16.872 --> 01:01:18.502
He suspends his service when he goes to the US.

01:01:20.142 --> 01:01:21.372
Was I seeing things?

01:01:22.342 --> 01:01:23.342
No, that can't be right.

01:01:23.812 --> 01:01:24.942
I'm sure it was Woo Jin.

01:01:29.112 --> 01:01:30.112
(Taxi, Vacant)

01:01:47.832 --> 01:01:48.832
Who are you?

01:01:56.012 --> 01:02:00.712
I also sent invitations to the VIPs you chose for the opening reception.

01:02:01.582 --> 01:02:04.482
- Good job. Thank you, honey. - No problem.

01:02:06.182 --> 01:02:08.792
So my Yeong Ra's finally becoming an artist.

01:02:09.322 --> 01:02:10.322
How do you feel?

01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:15.392
What masterpiece are you hiding? You wouldn't let me in your studio.

01:02:15.992 --> 01:02:19.102
I just focus better when I'm working alone.

01:02:20.102 --> 01:02:21.102
Of course.

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:25.472
Did you give Seong Jae an invite? He needs to invite his own guests.

01:02:26.302 --> 01:02:28.912
Not yet. I was planning to ask him first.

01:02:28.972 --> 01:02:31.542
- Right. - Seong Jae's been so busy.

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:34.952
I know, he's been busy.

01:02:35.482 --> 01:02:37.012
Remarkably busy.

01:02:38.582 --> 01:02:39.752
Seong Jae? Why?

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:43.222
I'm home.

01:02:43.992 --> 01:02:44.992
But...

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:46.492
Someone's here.

01:02:47.592 --> 01:02:48.592
Who?

01:02:54.762 --> 01:02:55.772
Mom, I'm home.

01:03:49.422 --> 01:03:51.862
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:52.192 --> 01:03:55.732
You're in way over your head, you fool.

01:03:56.262 --> 01:03:59.062
Hey, Lee Su Bin. It's not your place to worry for Seong Jae.

01:03:59.132 --> 01:04:01.132
Who are you to worry about Seong Jae?

01:04:01.202 --> 01:04:03.802
Ji Gang Oh, come home. We're nothing to each other now.

01:04:03.902 --> 01:04:05.372
Do you want my name removed from the family register?

01:04:05.742 --> 01:04:09.772
I didn't commit a mortal sin. So I'm dropping the formalities.

01:04:09.842 --> 01:04:12.842
I'll call you by your first name. I don't care what you say.

01:04:12.912 --> 01:04:13.942
Excuse me, but...

01:04:14.582 --> 01:04:16.552
By any chance... Just maybe...

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:18.782
Is there something you're hiding?

01:04:18.852 --> 01:04:20.952
What were you thinking, showing up out of the blue?

01:04:21.052 --> 01:04:22.152
Don't you think it's time people knew?

01:04:22.222 --> 01:04:25.792
Shut it. Do you want to live or die?
