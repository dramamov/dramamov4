You're Ms. Kim Yeong Ran, right?

Who are you calling?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.500
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:22.000
You're not very good at lying, actually.

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:26.200
Don't you remember the first day you saw me
at Chairman Ga Sung Ho's residence?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.700
Thank you.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:43.733
I was going to greet you whenever we
crossed paths because I'm so grateful.

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.400
But,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.400
I only ever saw your back.

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.933
I've figured it all out.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.067
But are you still going to pretend?

00:02:02.967 --> 00:02:04.567
Yes.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.133
Mr. Jeon Dong Min.

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.067
Can you keep pretending not to know until the end?

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.533
I told you at the strawberry field.

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.700
That kind of thing doesn't work on me.

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:23.933
Then what do you want?

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:26.267
What will you do with my weakness?

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:28.467
You think I found your weakness?

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:31.867
Jeez, this is really absurd.

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:34.200
I want nothing. Happy now?

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:39.200

about my past, they all pity me.

juvenile detention history.

You've read the articles.
You know all this, right?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.000
But you know,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.900
sharing sadness doesn't make it half,
it just becomes a weakness.

And then if something goes missing,

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:20.400
they all immediately
suspect me of being the thief.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:24.233
Will you be any different, Jeon Dong Min?

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:26.800
Then let me ask you this.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.700
Did you look at me with the same eyes
when I was Ms. Bu Se Mi

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:34.367
and when I was Kim Yeong Ran?

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.333
Since you were Kim Yeong Ran...

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.633
Enough.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.433
You've changed too, Mr. Jeon.

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:53.733
It's okay. That's human nature.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.233
You wouldn't believe me if I denied it?

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:06.967
Just ask for money instead.

00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:08.967
That would be simpler.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.433
I didn't know you were so eloquent.

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:16.400
But,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.267
I really won't say anything.

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:21.000

You drank earlier.

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:47.400

something like that all of a sudden?

Why are you so careless, Madam?

Since he's a father,

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:31.200

Why are you acting like you've seen a ghost?

Attorney Lee, we did our research too.

About what exactly?

00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:11.367
What was late Chairman Ga Sung Ho's ironclad rule?

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:13.867
It's about hiring all employees
as full-time staff, right?

00:09:13.867 --> 00:09:16.933
Both Yang Cheol Su and I
signed full-time contracts.

00:09:16.933 --> 00:09:20.667
Therefore, unilateral termination
would be considered wrongful dismissal,

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:24.133
especially since you're not even the employer.

00:09:24.133 --> 00:09:27.233
This has all the signs of wrongful termination.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.033
and though he seems cold,

00:13:31.033 --> 00:13:36.367
he's actually really thoughtful
when you look closely.

00:13:36.367 --> 00:13:41.933
He seems like the kind of guy
you could plan a future with, right?

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.133
You noticed all that in such a short time.

00:13:48.033 --> 00:13:51.900
Friend, want to stay here
and grow strawberries with me?

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.967
Put down roots here like these strawberries.

00:13:59.433 --> 00:14:04.100
Strawberries are sensitive
to temperature and humidity.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.067
But this greenhouse stands firm,

00:14:07.067 --> 00:14:09.000
blocking rain, wind, and cold.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.267
It protects them from all that.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.100
Feels secure, doesn't it?

00:14:14.533 --> 00:14:17.067
How could a person put down roots?

00:14:17.067 --> 00:14:19.367
We're not strawberries.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.967

Yes.

Yeah, you mentioned that yesterday.

asking questions about you.

I said Ju Won's mom left you
for a rich guy and is living happily now.

Really, it's okay.

Wow, Miss. You're great at picking strawberries.

00:17:20.733 --> 00:17:23.633
I tend to pick things up quickly once I learn.

This could lead to legal issues.
He might lose his executive position.

Director Ga Seon Yeong
has only worked at the university.

What does she know about management?

But she's the founder's descendant.

Though Gaseong Group thrived
thanks to the Korean Wave trend,

You'll understand once you review them.

00:20:24.167 --> 00:20:28.000
In our family, I yielded my position
to Seon Woo simply because I'm a woman,

This is absolutely not acceptable.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.167

you can't just ask me to hire anyone.

has financial problems, and also...

00:25:27.033 --> 00:25:29.100
Don't worry about finances.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.933
I'll cover Ms. Baek Hye Ji's salary myself.

00:25:30.933 --> 00:25:33.167
Miss, why are you really doing this?

00:25:33.167 --> 00:25:35.333
Did you do anything wrong to...

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:36.533
Principal.

00:25:36.533 --> 00:25:38.300
Mr. Jeon Dong Min

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.900
discovered my true identity.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.433
Why were you so careless?

00:25:44.433 --> 00:25:46.000
If everyone who knows my true identity

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.967
remains within my sight,
I can keep them under control.

00:25:48.967 --> 00:25:50.800
I need to ask you a favor.

00:25:53.933 --> 00:25:55.833
Yes.

00:25:55.833 --> 00:25:57.633
I guess there's no choice.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.167
Our dear Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:26:02.167 --> 00:26:04.300
I see what you mean.

00:26:06.233 --> 00:26:08.167
Sit.

00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:10.067
That's right.

00:26:10.067 --> 00:26:11.700
Wait.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.733
Sit.

00:26:16.733 --> 00:26:18.233
There you go. Good.

00:26:18.233 --> 00:26:20.033
Dong Min, I heard

00:26:20.033 --> 00:26:21.433
you found out Ms. Bu's true identity.

00:26:21.433 --> 00:26:22.533
So what did you get in return

00:26:22.533 --> 00:26:25.333
for keeping her real identity a secret?

00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:26.667
Money? Land? Or...

00:26:26.667 --> 00:26:28.700
Oh, so you did make a deal?

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.500
No, no.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.333
You trust me, right?

00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:37.733
I didn't start this. She proposed it first.

00:26:37.733 --> 00:26:39.333
Trust me.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.900
I need to go to the restroom.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.867
What? That makes it even weirder.

00:26:47.267 --> 00:26:49.500
Good morning, everyone.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.200
Hello, Miss.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.900
You look beautiful as always today.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.900
Miss, did you dream about me?

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.800
No wonder, I had a really good dream.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.500
You'll ride in my car, right?

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.133
I even have ginger tea in it, Miss.

00:27:04.133 --> 00:27:06.200
Ah, I already agreed to ride with Dong Min.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.233
Maybe next time, thanks.

00:27:08.233 --> 00:27:09.367
Hello, Dong Min.

00:27:09.367 --> 00:27:10.467
Have a nice day.

00:27:10.467 --> 00:27:13.167
- Yes.
- Good work today.

00:27:17.033 --> 00:27:19.133
You said you were going with me?

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.833
Are you spying on me? Are you afraid I'll tell?

00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:24.367
'I don't need money or anything else.'

00:27:24.367 --> 00:27:26.100
How am I supposed to trust someone who says that?

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.433
Then what will make you trust me?

00:27:27.433 --> 00:27:29.067
We'll figure that out over time.
For now, let's go.

00:27:29.067 --> 00:27:30.967
We'll be late for kindergarten.

00:27:42.933 --> 00:27:47.300
Recent exposes about Gaseong Group Vice President
Ga Seon Woo's abuse of power and corruption

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.967
have sparked nationwide boycotts
of Gaseong Ramyeon products.

00:27:50.967 --> 00:27:53.167
Vice President Ga Seon Woo is suspected of

00:27:53.167 --> 00:27:56.400
trying to manipulate stock prices
by mobilizing certain forces...

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.033
Ju Won's been so rebellious lately. Never listens.

00:28:03.033 --> 00:28:05.033
Seven-year-olds are terrifying.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.033
Don't try to change the subject.

00:28:08.033 --> 00:28:10.233
I check the news daily.

00:28:15.633 --> 00:28:18.233
I don't know much about chaebols,

00:28:18.233 --> 00:28:22.367
but if stock prices are affected,
wouldn't people get more sensitive?

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:24.233
That's how it's shown in dramas.

00:28:24.233 --> 00:28:28.400
This is my first time dealing
with something like this too, so I'm not sure yet.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.400
I wasn't great at math back in school.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.867
Were you good at it?

00:28:38.867 --> 00:28:40.633
Of course I wasn't.

00:28:41.833 --> 00:28:43.767
Thought so.

00:28:49.233 --> 00:28:50.300
Enjoy your meal.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.333
Thank you for the food.

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.767
I hate carrots.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.767
Carrots are a secret.

00:29:09.767 --> 00:29:11.367
Secret.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.367
Miss, let's have snacks and play hair salon.

00:29:18.367 --> 00:29:19.833
Alright.

00:29:19.833 --> 00:29:22.833
[Baek Hye Ji's Resume]

00:29:22.833 --> 00:29:27.033
You really had the elite path, huh?

00:29:27.033 --> 00:29:30.000
Is this Iseon Kids or what?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.100
Oh, Lord.

00:29:35.367 --> 00:29:36.967
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

00:29:36.967 --> 00:29:41.467
Let's skip formalities. We both know the truth.

00:29:46.533 --> 00:29:49.567
That's exactly what I wanted, Principal.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.667
Since when have you known Madam's name?

00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:55.500
Since she came into Chairman Ga's household.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.300
Oh, so not very long then.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.667
It's longer than your time.

00:30:00.667 --> 00:30:02.633
Didn't know that, did you?

00:30:02.633 --> 00:30:05.700
In relationships, what's
more important than how long?

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.100
Depth. It's about depth.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.833
What do you want from Madam?

00:30:10.833 --> 00:30:12.500
Me?

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.900
I want to eat together and watch movies.

00:30:16.233 --> 00:30:17.800
But you,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.233
here talk about emotional depth,

00:30:22.233 --> 00:30:23.933
yet want something else, huh?

00:30:23.933 --> 00:30:25.333
No, no, no.

00:30:25.333 --> 00:30:27.633
What 'something else'?

00:30:27.633 --> 00:30:29.067
I'm just trying to show

00:30:29.067 --> 00:30:32.933
that Madam and I have a somewhat

00:30:32.933 --> 00:30:36.867
special relationship, that's important.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.233
Do you think Madam sees it that way too?

00:30:45.967 --> 00:30:47.000
Huh?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.567
- I'm the prince.
- What?

00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:50.067
I said I'm the prince.

00:30:50.067 --> 00:30:52.000
What's this sound?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.833
What's this sound?

00:30:55.833 --> 00:30:58.867
- I'm the prince.
- I'm telling you, I'm the prince.

00:30:58.867 --> 00:31:02.500
- Go away.
- No! I'm the prince!

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.000
- I'm the prince.
- I'll add another one.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.633
Yes.

00:31:09.633 --> 00:31:12.833
You look pretty. Now you're a princess.

00:31:12.833 --> 00:31:13.867
Yeah?

00:31:13.867 --> 00:31:15.267
- I'm the prince.
- I'm telling you, I'm the prince.

00:31:15.267 --> 00:31:16.433
Strawberry class.

00:31:16.433 --> 00:31:18.200
Everyone focus. Quiet!

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.200
Quiet! Quiet!

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.833
Oh, my.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.667
Ms. Bu Se Mi became a princess.

00:31:25.667 --> 00:31:26.667
Pretty, right?

00:31:26.667 --> 00:31:27.767
So pretty.

00:31:27.767 --> 00:31:30.900
- Yes.
- Wow, friend.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.833
The crown's really beautiful.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.067
No! Construction! Dangerous! Principal! Principal!

00:31:39.067 --> 00:31:41.867
Thank you. Thank you.

00:31:41.867 --> 00:31:44.133
What's happening?

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.833
What are you doing right now?

00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:02.400
What are you doing? Wait, this is...

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.533
Oh my, what...

00:32:04.533 --> 00:32:07.133
What are you doing right now?

00:32:07.133 --> 00:32:09.033
The landowner

00:32:09.033 --> 00:32:11.867
asked us to dig here
along the yellow line on this map.

00:32:11.867 --> 00:32:15.267
Sir, this is a kindergarten.

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:17.100
Jeez.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.433
Can't you see the children?

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.700
We're just doing what we were told.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.867
Kang Seong Tae!

00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:30.733
I'll kill this punk!

00:32:30.733 --> 00:32:31.867
Huh? Hey!

00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:34.667
You! What are you doing? You!

00:32:34.667 --> 00:32:35.700
Oh, my.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.933
Wait, this is...

00:32:36.933 --> 00:32:39.267
- Oh my, friend.
- Principal.

00:32:41.633 --> 00:32:43.267
Friend!

00:32:43.267 --> 00:32:44.633
Are you okay?

00:32:44.633 --> 00:32:47.000
Madam... I mean, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.733
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:52.600
Principal and teachers should go that way.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.700
Go quickly.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.400
- Take care of the children first.
- Kids first.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.400
Follow your teacher.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.633
Come on kids, I'll take you.

00:33:04.133 --> 00:33:06.067
Hey, stop!

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.400
You just touched my stuff, huh? Huh?

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.800
You're both trespassing on my land.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.933
- Film this.
- Got it.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.667
Stop filming.

00:33:16.667 --> 00:33:19.733
No, keep filming.

00:33:19.733 --> 00:33:22.300
Restore this first.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.567
What if the kids get hurt while playing here?

00:33:24.567 --> 00:33:26.033
Then don't let them play here.

00:33:26.033 --> 00:33:27.367
Not my problem.

00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:28.567
What did you just say?

00:33:28.567 --> 00:33:30.933
- Dong Min.
- Keep recording.

00:33:34.433 --> 00:33:36.200
Hello? Yes, police station?

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.467
This is Iseon Kindergarten in Muchang.

00:33:38.467 --> 00:33:41.533
There are intruders trespassing
on private property.

00:33:41.533 --> 00:33:44.233
An innocent citizen is being harassed.

00:33:44.233 --> 00:33:46.133
Please dispatch officers immediately.

00:33:46.133 --> 00:33:48.267
Okay.

00:33:48.267 --> 00:33:49.367
- Did you get it on film?
- Yes.

00:33:49.367 --> 00:33:50.567
Got it all, right?

00:33:50.567 --> 00:33:52.167
Good job.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:53.900
You threatening me now?

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.467
Got all the evidence.

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:58.600
Trespassing on private property.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.533
I'll make sure you two

00:34:00.533 --> 00:34:02.567
rot in jail.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.733
Butler.

00:34:05.733 --> 00:34:07.500
Could the will really be here?

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.200
I've searched everywhere for days.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.333
This is the only place left.

00:34:14.133 --> 00:34:17.133
But if we keep entering the wrong password

00:34:17.133 --> 00:34:19.433
and it locks permanently.

00:34:19.433 --> 00:34:21.233
That would be terrible.

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:32.767
If the will's there, I'll stake my life on it.

00:34:35.467 --> 00:34:38.600

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.833
Big trouble.

00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:47.133
Ms. Bu Se Mi got arrested.

00:34:47.133 --> 00:34:49.100
Police?

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.067
No, background check.

00:34:54.133 --> 00:34:55.933
Attorney Lee, where are you going?

00:34:55.933 --> 00:34:57.633
Why do you care?

00:34:57.633 --> 00:34:59.133
Are you two a package deal?

00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:00.833
Why not just date already?

00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:02.300
Attorney!

No matter what happens.

01:02:30.233 --> 01:02:32.967
Why are you protecting me?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.067
And how can I trust your words?

01:02:37.067 --> 01:02:40.300
Wow, you really don't trust people.

01:02:41.067 --> 01:02:43.900
Should we make a written contract?

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:53.900
I'll take your silence as agreement.

01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:52.900
Want to try it too, Miss?

01:05:01.233 --> 01:05:02.467
Kim So Yeong?

01:05:02.467 --> 01:05:04.433
Oh, jeez.

01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:09.067
This young brat...

01:05:09.067 --> 01:05:12.133
How dare you call elders by name?

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.233
Secretary Ham.

01:05:19.233 --> 01:05:20.867
Yes, Professor.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.533
Tell Lee Don.

01:05:24.933 --> 01:05:27.400
If Kim Yeong Ran doesn't show up,

01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:30.167
we'll kill her mother.

01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:31.900
Understood.

01:05:53.133 --> 01:05:56.133
♫ Now is the time ♫

01:05:56.133 --> 01:06:04.167
♫ Even hidden scars will shine ♫

01:06:04.167 --> 01:06:07.300
♫ I share the light ♫

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:14.067
♫ I'll brighten the days shrouded in darkness ♫

01:06:14.067 --> 01:06:16.067
♫ It's not over ♫

01:06:16.067 --> 01:06:21.200
♫ The present isn't bound by the past ♫

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.367
If you decide to leave,

01:06:23.367 --> 01:06:24.733
please tell me first.

01:06:24.733 --> 01:06:27.667
We have a visitor.

01:06:27.667 --> 01:06:29.100
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.233
My daughter!

01:06:30.233 --> 01:06:31.667
How did you get here?

01:06:31.667 --> 01:06:34.400
Shouldn't you repay my care?

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.500
It's been a while.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.233
I called you for a favor.

01:06:37.233 --> 01:06:38.233
Ju Won.

01:06:38.233 --> 01:06:39.500
How dare you do this to me!

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.933
I'm used to being in charge.
Being the weaker party feels strange.

01:06:42.933 --> 01:06:45.067
What? Ju Won's missing?

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:48.167
If anything happens to Ju Won,
I won't forgive you.
