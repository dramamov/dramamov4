00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.570
but you never come!

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:20.870
You only care

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.960
about your own stuff!

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.340
Do you know I'm about to...

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:23.890
You, you, you!

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:24.980
You only think about yourself!

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.910
Have you ever considered how I feel?

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.480
Xu Qingli,

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.750
I have exams next week.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.360
Later, we received news.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.790
Baozhen actually got admitted.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.980
It was just a vocational college,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.150
but still,
she became the first college student

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.720
in our village.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.510
Xu Qingli sent a letter back,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.600
saying

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.180
that after she graduated,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.390
they'd return to the village and marry.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.080
Back then,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.860
Uncle Caizeng

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.750
was over the moon.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.870
Then one day,

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.240
a Crown sedan

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.790
showed up in the village.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.240
No one in our village

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.790
had ever seen such a nice car.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.200
Everyone craned their necks

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.730
to see where it was heading.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.320
It stopped right in front

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.400
of the Tian family's house.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.520
Only later did we find out

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.440
Tian Baozhen was engaged.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:30.420
[Capital of Nanyang Province, 2003]

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.790
Baozhen.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.360
Qingli.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.600
You've really changed.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:00.960
Yes.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.560
I just...

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.560
finished class.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.490
You're about to graduate?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.510
Yes.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:08.480
So...

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.200
what are your plans

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.150
for the future?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.480
Qingli,

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.100
let's find a quiet place

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.030
to talk.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.720
Sure.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.700
These past few years, I've come to see

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.490
you made the right choice.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.670
Impressive.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.790
You're about to finish college.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.900
But I've worked very hard too.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.870
These past few years,

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.930
you were studying,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200
and I was working.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.480
I've saved up some money.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:44.740
Baozhen...

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.940
I'm getting married.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.670
What?

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.230
I'm getting married.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:52.870
Getting married?

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.510
To whom?

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.120
Bao Desheng.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.270
The guy from Fucheng Sugar Factory.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.400
You should know him.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.480
Are you kidding me?

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.390
Bao Desheng?

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.780
You're going to marry him?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.840
Yes.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.270
He is

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.720
uneducated.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.200
Everyone knows that.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.250
You're going to marry him?

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.870
What's so good about him?

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.080
Don't talk nonsense

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.960
if you don't know.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.210
I don't believe it.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.200
Why wouldn't you believe it?

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.440
This is the life I want.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.150
Understand?

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.390
Do you love him?

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.010
Does it matter?

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.610
Doesn't it matter?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.480
No, it doesn't.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.390
You... You want to be

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.250
with someone you don't even love?

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.040
Feelings can be developed.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.670
Isn't that what people always say

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.330
when they urge a girl to marry?

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.870
Baozhen, stop joking.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.320
What's wrong with you, Baozhen?

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.630
What kind of joke is this?

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.910
I'm not joking.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.790
I know

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.180
you must have been upset lately

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.000
because I didn't visit you.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.720
I'll come see you every day from now on.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.440
Okay?

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.280
Then let me ask you a question.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.750
If the factory director's daughter and I

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.610
both pursued you at the same time,

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.830
who would you choose?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.840
Do I even need to think about it?

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.270
Of course...

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.470
Don't lie.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.090
Liars get struck by lightning.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.080
See?

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.850
It's fine when you do that,

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.630
but not when I do that?

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.150
You have all those grand principles

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.360
to lecture me.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.840
Marrying only for love

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.320
is just gambling.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.320
Love

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.790
is far more expensive and extravagant

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:01.720
than gold.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.670
Even if you have it today,

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.130
it might be gone tomorrow.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.420
Who can guarantee something
for a lifetime?

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.600
If I marry you

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.550
just for love,

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.150
what if you change your heart one day?

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.390
Who can I complain to?

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.080
Who should I cry to?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.630
Baozhen,

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.790
you know me.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.500
I would never change my heart.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:25.600
Baozhen,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.150
I can swear.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720
I will

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.320
treat you well my whole life.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.440
Why should I marry you

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.170
just because you're good to me?

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.270
Why?

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.620
You can't even say for sure

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.630
if it will rain today

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.960
or tomorrow.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.270
How dare you stand here

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.510
and promise something for a lifetime?

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.180
-Why can't I guarantee it?
-Besides,

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.200
I can't guarantee

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.130
that I'll love you forever either.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.090
Baozhen, what are you talking about?

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.110
Has studying scrambled your brain?

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.600
No.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.550
What are you talking about?

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.069
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.400
What's wrong with that?

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.369
It's perfectly normal.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:08.430
Normal?

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.589
Love takes two.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.339
Women have the right
to change their hearts too.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.750
Why would you want to change your heart?

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.109
Let me tell you, people are animalsâ€”

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.270
loving this person today,

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.530
that person tomorrow.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.069
You can't guarantee anything.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.109
Everyone likes novelty.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:27.030
If you'd chosen

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.640
the factory director's daughter just now,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.680
I would understand.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.140
I understand completely.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.210
I'm not saying you're bad.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.220
People have selfish desires.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.960
Everyone is like that.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:39.720
You are like that.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.270
I am like that too.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.070
Both men and women are like that.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.960
Look at yourself now,

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.160
Baozhen.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.610
You've been corrupted after all.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.920
I've been corrupted?

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.400
What is good?

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.310
What is bad?

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.200
Is planning for myself bad?

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.440
Does being good mean revolving around you

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.240
my whole life?

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.980
Do you want a good woman

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.530
or a woman

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.960
you can easily control?

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.240
Baozhen.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.960
Think about your mother.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.130
She was such a proper,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.270
good woman.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.200
If she saw you

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.160
like this now,

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.170
-what would she think?
-She would be happy for me.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.510
What?

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.480
She would be happy for me!

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.840
Happy I didn't follow in her footsteps.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.640
Happy that I'm not trapped

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.680
my whole life by being good,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.150
working like a slave,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.950
taking care of the whole family,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.680
unable to complain or resent,

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.030
and labeled a nag
just for grumbling a bit.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.400
Fifty years old.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.080
She died when she was only 50.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.680
The day she died,

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.410
she was still out in the field
cutting sugarcane.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.860
What did she get in the end?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.030
What did she get?

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.590
Not even half a year after she was gone,

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.390
my father got himself a new wife.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.920
Do you want that kind of life for me?

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.000
I don't want that!

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.030
I know if I continue with you like this,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.750
I can already see how it ends!

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.440
It's exactly that kind of life!

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.790
I don't want it!

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.880
What kind of life?

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.110
How do you know what my life

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.070
will be like?

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.720
I can make money too!

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.440
Baozhen.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.240
What did I do wrong?

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.950
If I did something wrong,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.400
I'd accept you treating me this way.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.810
When you went to that massage parlor,

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.000
where did you put me?

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.780
You think I don't know?

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.250
You think I haven't been tolerating it?

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.880
Baozhen, I...

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.240
I was drunk.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.640
You're treating me like a fool.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.750
I was drunk.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.400
I didn't want to...

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.440
Are you treating me like a fool?

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.350
No!

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.270
You left with me back then.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.530
I remember that kindness.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.630
But over these years,

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.960
finding jobs,

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.110
changing houses,

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.070
clearing up those messesâ€”

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.480
I've helped you a lot too,

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.110
Xu Qingli.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.720
Changing one's fate
requires shedding a layer of skin.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.480
It's harder for me to change my fate
than it is for you.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.070
I'm terrified that one wrong step

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.790
will ruin my whole life.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.240
Maybe you also think

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.310
I'm a bad woman.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.240
Everyone thinks

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.400
I'm a bad woman.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.400
It doesn't matter.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.640
I don't care.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.640
I just want to live a good life.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:42.890
What's a good life?

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.750
I've made my choice now.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.270
This is my choice!

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.880
You can't

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.940
give me what I want.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.280
Of course,

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680
what you wantâ€”I can't...

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.340
I can't fully provide either.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.480
Let's part on good terms.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.010
Baozhen.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.400
Baozhen!

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.960
â™ª Standing far away â™ª

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.650
â™ª Can't see the white clouds â™ª

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:41.810
â™ª What a peaceful scene â™ª

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:49.270
â™ª Who knows that bad luck
has quietly come? â™ª

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.190
[Wedding]

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440
I'm old.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.920
You young people enjoy yourselves.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.070
Thank you, Master Five,
for gracing us with your presence today.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.270
On your wedding day,

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.640
of course I'm happy.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.550
Baozhen!

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.510
â™ª Standing far away â™ª

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.590
Baozhen!

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.480
Baozhen!

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:23.510
â™ª Can't see the white clouds â™ª

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.960
I'm a bit tired today.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.090
You all go have fun.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:26.790
Okay.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.680
I won't be joining you.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.790
Baozhen!

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:40.310
â™ª What a peaceful scene â™ª

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.480
â™ª Who knows that bad luck
has quietly come? â™ª

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.240
Should we go for another round?

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.160
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.030
Where do you want to go?

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.030
-Pharaoh's!
-Pharaoh's!

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.400
Let's go! Get in the car!

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.590
â™ª You still haven't come back to me â™ª

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:11.350
â™ª The endless sorrow â™ª

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:17.890
â™ª From now on,
you'll have to endure it alone â™ª

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.480
Who are you looking for?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.560
Who are you looking for?

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.000
I'm looking for Bao Desheng.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.830
Is he here?

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.050
You're Mr. Bao's friend?

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.240
Over there.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.840
Come on, I'll take you to him.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.650
He's right here.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.130
It's him again.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.880
Mr. Bao.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.370
Your friend is here.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.030
-Let go! Let go!
-What are you doing?

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:57.440
Is everything okay?

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.350
I need to speak with Mr. Bao.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:59.640
It's my wedding day.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.140
Come, you.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:01.880
Come here.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.030
Sit here.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.350
Sit closer.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.400
Bro,

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.350
my apologies.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.130
Today is my wedding day.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.960
I haven't been able
to attend to you properly.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.000
It's fine.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.410
I know you're busy.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.030
So...

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:30.750
where's Baozhen?

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:31.280
Baozhen?

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.200
She's at home,

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.440
waiting for me.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.300
Why aren't you going home then?

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.190
I still have these friends to attend to.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:44.830
Let's drink then.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.640
Drink.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.270
What else do you want?

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.030
I just want...

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.030
I just want to say...

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.960
Baozhen isn't right for you.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.750
You can't marry her.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.000
Why can't I marry her?

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.350
Because you don't understand her.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.750
If I don't understand her, who does? You?

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:34.640
I do.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.290
You really don't understand Baozhen!

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.750
I do!

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.330
When I first met her,

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.650
where were you?

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.880
Bro, alright. Alright.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.160
I understand Baozhen!

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.610
Bro. Bro.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.000
You can't marry her.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.510
-Listen to me.
-Mr. Bao, you can't marry Baozhen!

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.400
I must marry Baozhen.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.550
What do you have to marry her?

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.720
Do you have money?

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.030
I will have money.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.040
I will marry her.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.590
What a buzzkill.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.240
Baozhen.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.720
Drag him away!

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.830
Mr. Bao.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.720
Don't...

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.200
Don't touch me!

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.890
Don't touch me!

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.750
I need to talk to Mr. Bao!

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:21.690
Let me tell you.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.720
If it weren't for Baozhen,

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.920
I would've killed you already!

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.510
I'm telling you.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.110
You kept man! You kept man!

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.150
You brat! You brat!

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.410
Is she yours?

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.510
Is she yours?

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.960
You kept man!

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.750
I'm calling you a kept man.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.200
Can't you hear me?

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.930
You kept man!

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.730
You kept man!

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.680
You kept man!

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.240
I've already married Baozhen.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.070
Later, I'll go home

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.550
and consummate our marriage!

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.650
You kept man!

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.880
You brat!

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.200
You loser!

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.400
Everyone knows the story!

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.890
You're just a worker in my factory.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.830
You want to marry Baozhen?

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:51.690
Keep dreaming.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.170
Everyone knows he's a kept man.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.160
Don't do this!

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:58.700
Mr. Bao!

00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.750
Drag him away.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.440
-Don't touch me!
-Baozhen supported you,

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.300
gave you money,

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.240
and fed you!

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.000
Or you think

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:05.640
you'd have survived till now?

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.200
Get lost!

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.270
Come on, say it again!

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:10.790
Who's a kept man?

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.790
Who's a kept man?

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.270
Here!

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.510
Stab me here!

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.150
Come on. Right here.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.960
Here, come on.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.240
Come on, here. Come on.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.550
Come on. Come on.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.680
Here, stab me!

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.790
Lots of guts here!

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.200
You're useless, trash!

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.550
Killing my buzz.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.480
Bao Desheng,

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.240
I will kill you.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:48.830
Come on.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.270
I'll kill you!

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.510
Hurry up!

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.270
I...

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.400
I will kill you.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.550
I will kill you.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.070
I will kill you!

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.240
I will kill you!

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.180
Dogs with tails strut,

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.880
and so do dogs without!

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.090
Alright, alright!

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.410
Everyone, let's continue drinking!

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.320
What are you laughing at?

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.200
What are you laughing at?

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:04.880
What are you laughing at?

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.060
Stop laughing!

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.490
Everyone's laughing at me!

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.110
Stop.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.440
Stand over there.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.500
Stop laughing.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.920
Or I'll kill you.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.270
Stop laughing.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.590
Stop laughing.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.270
Stop laughing!

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.680
Stop laughing!

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.030
Stop laughing!

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.350
Stop laughing!

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:33.960
Help!

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.550
Help me!

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.810
[Weihai, 2011]

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.570
Zhen, you're here.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.780
Zhen, you're here.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.750
Morning.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.240
Morning, Madam.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:20.850
Thanks for your hard work.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:21.510
No problem.

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.210
Have you seen this person?

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.590
No, I haven't.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.260
Really, I haven't.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:47.000
I've seen this person.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.440
You have?

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.640
This guy

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.700
came here a few days ago,

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.920
looking for the boss lady.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.250
He asked what her name is

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.550
and where she was, things like that.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.560
I just saw him.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:58.750
When I was taking out the trash earlier,

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.440
he was right there in that alley.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.480
He was still there just now.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.740
Yes, that alley.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:38.750
Xu Qingli!

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.030
Xu Qingli!

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.680
Get up!

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:43.160
Get up!

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Who is it?

00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.750
Baozhen?

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.880
Why are you here?

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.480
What's wrong?

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.830
You've gone too far!

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.200
How dare you kill someone!

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.060
What? What are you talking about?

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.400
I killed someone?

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400
Stop pretending.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.720
Don't play dumb!

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.590
What's wrong?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.060
Why did you slap me?

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:19.960
You killed someone.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.240
You killed Bao Desheng,

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.070
didn't you?

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.060
When did I kill him?

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.790
Last night,

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.550
Bao Desheng was stabbed to death

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.640
at the old bridge.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:32.470
The groomsmen said

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.510
they saw you

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.480
shouting

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.110
and swearing you'd kill him.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.550
I was...

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.640
drunk.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.320
I was... talking nonsense.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.350
No matter what nonsense you were talking,

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.160
everyone is saying it was you.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.070
Do you understand?

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.400
Bao Desheng is dead?

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:48.880
Bao Desheng is dead.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.240
Completely dead.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.240
What does that have to do with me?

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.420
What does this have to do with you?

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.350
Everyone is saying

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:00.290
that you killed him.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.270
Do you understand?

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.070
It wasn't me.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.720
I can go to them!

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.670
And I can explain to them!

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.550
The Bao family

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.760
is looking for you like crazy.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.590
What good will explaining to them do?

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.190
Then what proof do they have?

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.190
They don't need proof.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.030
If they find you, you're finished!

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.800
Got it?

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.150
What should I do now?

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.710
Kapok Lane.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.260
You've been there before.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.190
I have a friend there

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.320
who runs a small inn.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:29.790
Go hide there for now.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.800
Listen to me.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.230
Wait.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.320
-Before things are cleared up...
-But I didn't kill him.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.550
Before things are cleared up,

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.360
don't come back

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.480
and don't run away!

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:42.440
Understand?

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.860
Will you ever stop?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.060
Will you ever stop?

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.280
Doing this all day long!

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:56.190
What are you banging for?

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.670
You want me to kill you?

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.970
-Get out!
-Brother.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.760
Brave enough to bang on walls,

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.150
but not brave enough to say it to my face?

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:11.230
Forget it.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:11.810
Brat!

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.480
Where are you hiding? Come out!

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.090
-Stay out of this!
-Don't get so angry.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:15.840
Get out!

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.070
We can just change our room.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.400
Do you have a death wish?

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:18.800
Do you know

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.730
what happens when you mess with me?

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.320
Where are you hiding? Come out!

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.190
Get out!

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.480
Do you have a death wish?

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.510
Bang, bang, bang!

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.440
All you do is bang!

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.570
Come out if you dare!

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.400
It's me.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.230
Baozhen.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.910
You finally came.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.850
Baozhen.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.880
Sit, sit.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:01.810
Baozhen.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:04.920
What's the situation outside?

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.440
You have to run.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.760
Why?

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.960
The Bao family is looking for you
everywhere.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.070
They've spent a lot of money.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:12.440
All those

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.590
shady friends of yours from before

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:14.480
are looking for you everywhere,

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.510
waiting to catch you and claim reward.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:17.630
Why catch me?

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.500
I didn't kill anyone.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.030
I didn't kill Bao Desheng.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.190
But everyone's saying you killed him.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.590
I can go to the police station!

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:27.590
I'll go right now!

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.720
Alright.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.360
Even if the police believe it wasn't you,

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.560
the Bao family won't.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.150
Bao Desheng was their only son.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.030
He died for no reason,

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.710
while you're here alive and well.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.920
How could his parents accept that?

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.510
How could his uncles

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.630
let you off?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.860
They'll definitely catch you
to pay with your life.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:37:59.670
Why?

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.360
I didn't kill anyone!

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.760
What did I do?

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:18.880
There's some money here.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.740
Go somewhere else to hide for now!

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.630
I won't hide.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:23.150
Why should I hide?

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:25.360
I'll go back to Yafen Village
to my father.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.500
Are you crazy?

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:28.710
The Bao family is looking for you
everywhere.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.190
Go somewhere else to hide for now.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.880
I'm not asking you to hide forever.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.480
Just get through this first.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.630
Tomorrow is
Bao Desheng's seventh-day ceremony.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.590
I guess the Bao family
won't have time for you.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:41.650
Leave at midnight.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.140
What about you?

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:51.320
I have my own plans.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.520
The police already questioned me once.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.030
The Bao family can't control me now.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.330
But they all say I'm...

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.550
a jinx.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.000
They say I bring misfortune to my husband.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.010
So I can't stay in Jialin anymore.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.360
And I don't want to stay here either.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.000
Baozhen,

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.660
let's leave this place together.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.510
I won't go with you.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.740
Where will you go then?

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.600
To the north, I guess.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.930
I'm used to the sound of the waves.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.890
I'll find a place by the sea.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.540
Listening to the waves

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.370
helps me sleep better.

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:55.710
Baozhen.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.320
I know

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.590
you've always cared about me.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Otherwise, why would you

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.150
have found an inn

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.660
and gathered information for me?

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.520
Now that Bao Desheng is dead,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.140
we can leave this place together.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.230
You're crazy!

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.440
I'm helping myself!

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:22.880
With your personality,

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:24.150
if you get caught,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.480
you'll implicate me.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.230
That would be even worse!

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.680
What about my personality?

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.320
What do you know about my personality?

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.150
Let me tell you.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.880
Bao Desheng...

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.070
was killed by me.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.360
It couldn't be you.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:04.240
After all that's happened these days,

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.960
I've seen clearly

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:09.650
it couldn't be you.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.440
Maybe I never

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.040
should've asked you
to leave with me back then.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.410
If you had stayed

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.170
in the village your whole life,

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.370
none of this would have happened.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.880
Qingli,

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:35.110
forget me.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.630
From now on,

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:40.320
take good care of yourself.
