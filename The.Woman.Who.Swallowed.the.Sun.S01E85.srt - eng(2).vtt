00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.680
(Episode 85)

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.250
What are you thinking so hard about?

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.620
Just thinking about a few things.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.020
Are you bothered about
firing your eldest daughter?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.760
She has nothing to do
with the company anymore.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.790
Bring her back then.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.660
Why would I? She's an ungrateful brat.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.900
She's messed with me
and hurt the company time and time again.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.870
But she has the largest stake after you.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.370
She's the second-largest shareholder.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.000
And besides,
she's part of the owner's family.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.210
That's why she should have done better.
It's infuriating just thinking about it.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.080
I was backstabbed
by the one I trusted most.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.380
If it had been Ji Seop,
I could've just brushed it off.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.850
But this is the worst kind of betrayal.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.250
Then you should cut her off completely.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.820
That way, she won't be able to say
the company is hers for the taking.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.960
She said that?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.830
To Se Ri.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.600
She said that since the will makes her
the acting chairman in your absence,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.600
she'll take over your position one day.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.730
So she brought up my will, did she?

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.740
That's why I'm worried.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.470
Did you really put that in your will?

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.450
She's already greedy for the chairmanship,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.080
and she just wants control of the company.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.310
So I'm worried.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.580
Who knows what else she might do.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.390
And if something were to happen to you...

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.770
She thinks if I'm gone, Mingang is hers?

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.840
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.180
So that's why she tried
to send me to that nursing home.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.450
Thatâ€™s what she was thinking.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.320
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.920
Hey, Lawyer Park, it's me.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.160
I'm calling about my will.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.260
I think it's time to make some revisions.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.000
Hey, Lawyer Park. What's up?

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.240
Chairman Min just requested
to have his will amended and notarized.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.010
What are you talking about?
Why the sudden change to the will?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.810
How would I know?

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.280
He could have had a change of heart.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.250
Did he say specifically
what he wanted to change?

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.620
He wants to delete the clause
stating that in his absence,

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.890
his eldest daughter will take over
as acting chairman.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.590
What?

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.330
What did you say?

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.030
Did my father really say that?

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.330
He's scheduled a meeting
with Lawyer Park for next week.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.500
Darn it.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.640
I'll meet you there right now.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I'm on my way.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.280
Why does he want to revise
his will all of a sudden?

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.680
Don't you think that woman
put him up to it?

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.580
No. The only ones who know about
that clause are the chairman, me,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.150
and you.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920
If it's not her,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.660
it means as soon as she fired me,
he seized the chance to change the will.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.230
Two of a kind, aren't they?

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.360
That's not the point right now.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.200
If the will is changed,
it can't be undone.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.830
That was our last hope.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.440
So do something!

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.900
Are you just going to stand there
and watch?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.410
My father is
going to pass away eventually.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.310
No, even before that, if for some reason
he can't fulfill his duties as chairman,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.880
I must be acting chairman to kick her out
and seize control of the company, right?

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.250
Do you want to see me go down like this?

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.190
If I go down, so do you, Kim Sun Jae.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.360
There is one way.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.290
What is it?

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.300
To stop him from changing the will...

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.500
and get you reinstated,

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.140
it's the last card I have to play.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.340
What is it already?

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.770
But first, I have one condition.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.750
(Mingang Distribution)

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.050
They say a crisis creates opportunity.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.490
Now I finally understand what that means.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.700
About CEO Min Kyung Chae...

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.330
Are you going to leave her in the cold?

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.370
Do you think you're in any position
to say that?

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.600
You're a big part of the reason
she was fired.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.840
If you had advised her properly,
would she have gotten so out of control?

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.680
You have to be able to tell people
the hard truth sometimes.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.850
All you do is stand by and suck up to her,
telling her only what she wants to hear.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.220
I'm tempted to fire you along with her,
but I'm holding back.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.560
Then don't hold back.
Go ahead and fire me too.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.030
What did you say?

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.500
I'm CEO Min's man,
so there's nothing I wouldn't do for her.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.700
That's why I'm trying to stop you
from changing your will.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.130
How did you find out about that?

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.740
Chairman Tae of Yangmi Construction...

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.110
is currently under investigation
by the prosecutors.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.810
Chairman Tae? Why, all of a sudden?

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.310
Because his slush fund manager
betrayed him.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.010
A conglomerate head creating
an illegal slush fund.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.050
When a story like that gets out,
who do you think gets hurt more?

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.390
The head of the company?

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.960
Or the underling who was just managing it?

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.100
So are you saying I could end up
just like Chairman Tae?

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.730
Look at this punk.
How dare you threaten me!

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.600
So what's your point?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.040
As I said, I'm CEO Min's man,
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for her.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.680
Call off the changes to your will...

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.350
and reinstate her as CEO.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.090
Who does he think he is,
changing his will?

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.360
That's my last lifeline.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.040
How did it go?

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.510
It went well.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.980
My father really agreed
not to change the will?

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.050
When I set my mind on something,
I make it happen.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.350
How on earth did you manage that?

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.590
Did you work some kind of magic?

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.990
Now, you need to give me an answer
regarding my terms.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.660
Your terms?

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.600
Marry me.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.730
Marry you?

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.700
After we're married,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.840
we can turn Mingang Distribution
into a real powerhouse.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.070
We'll get rid of pests like
Lucia and Moon Tae Kyung.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.840
And for Min Soo Jung, Min Ji Seop,
we'll crush them and their family ties.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.180
We should show the world
that the new owner of Mingang...

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.450
will be Min Kyung Chae.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.020
I'll be right there to help you.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.390
Sounds like a pretty good deal for you,
wouldn't you say?

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.420
So, what's your answer?

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.490
Fine.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.460
What wouldn't I do
to become the owner of Mingang?

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.840
That punk, Lawyer Kim...

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.310
He's really going to hold this
over my head?

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.150
What are you thinking so deeply about?

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.720
Have you decided
what you're going to do about your will?

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.590
That's what's giving me such a headache.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.560
Why? It's your decision.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.930
Who's going to stop you?

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.530
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.260
It's too complicated
to tell you everything.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:45.100
You'd rather I just cut
Kyung Chae out of the will, wouldn't you?

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.270
Does what I want really matter?

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.140
I'm not saying this...

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.980
because I hold a grudge
against your eldest daughter.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.310
Yes, what she did to me was infuriating,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.280
but what I truly can't forgive...

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.480
is that she tried to get rid of you
to become the acting chairman.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.590
That's it.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.690
Who knows what she'll try to pull next?

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.090
But you should do as you see fit.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.230
If your hands are tied, what can you do?

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.780
Don't forget what I told you.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.410
That the company belongs to me.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.220
And I did remember your birthday.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.680
How could I forget?

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.720
My own daughter's birthday.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.520
It just slipped my mind.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.420
I didn't actually forget.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.130
I could never forget your birthday.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.630
Not after what you mean to me.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.600
What are you doing out here?

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.070
I was just on my way up to apologize
for missing your birthday.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.410
You don't have to apologize.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.940
What are you talking about?

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.280
I'm your mother,
and I missed your birthday.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.580
Of course I'm sorry.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.480
Let's go back to your room.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.560
Don't you put strange ideas
in my daughter's head.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.600
She just barely got her act together,

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.700
and I don't want her ending up
like her cruel sister.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.770
"Cruel sister?"

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.000
It'd be a disaster if she became someone
who'd do anything...

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.170
to get what she wanted.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.740
You're not going to pretend you don't know
what you did to me, are you?

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.860
You don't have to walk
on eggshells around me.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.860
I'm not mad at you.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.870
I got into an accident
because of a prank text someone sent me.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.070
I was a little on edge that day.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.170
And here I thought you were mad at me.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.480
It was your birthday.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.780
Someone I know...

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.750
also has the same birthday.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.250
Who?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.820
It must be fate.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.490
How can I have the same birthday
as someone else?

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.560
Who is it? Is it someone you know well?

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.620
I'd like to meet them.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.660
If you'd been born into a normal family...

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.630
and raised by normal, loving parents,

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.100
would things have been different?

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.140
Then maybe you wouldn't have done
such a terrible thing to my Mi So.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.310
I still hate you and resent you.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.070
But as much as I do...

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.280
What are you thinking about?

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.050
It's nothing.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.590
You'll stay with me again tonight, right?

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:01.970
Yes.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.770
What did you mean...

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.640
when you said
Chairman Min has changed his mind?

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.610
He was about to change his will
at any second,

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:11.810
but now he's hesitating.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.180
Someone's whispering in his ear.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.710
And I don't need to mention
who that someone is.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.550
So what do we do now?

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.350
With this dirty money, Min Doo Sik
and Kim Sun Jae are in the same boat.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.990
They're so tangled up,
neither can afford to cut the other loose.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.990
Trying to drive a wedge between them
from the outside is a long shot,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.860
so we need to exploit
a crack from within...

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.100
and make Chairman Min turn on Kim Sun Jae.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.500
Is that even possible?

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.440
There is one way.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.340
What if we let
Chairman Min Doo Sik know...

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.610
that Kim Sun Jae is keeping
a double ledger?

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.780
Last time, you noted the discrepancies
in Mingang's cash flow and funds...

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.820
and said there was no clear evidence.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.090
That's why we need to make Chairman Min...

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.620
get suspicious of Kim Sun Jae on his own.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.920
That would be great,
if we could pull it off,

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.860
but is there a way to do that?

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.730
I have an idea.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.970
Yes, I'll see you there.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.700
I'm on my way.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.570
You seem to be a very busy man.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.470
Is there a rule against me being busy?

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.640
Did you think I'd be moping in a corner
just because CEO Min was fired?

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.910
Your former boss was just forced out,

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.450
and you're at work
like it's any other day.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.850
I'm just a little surprised.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.120
Someone has to hold down the fort.
How else am I supposed to protect Mingang?

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.190
Mingang is in
a very precarious situation right now...

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.360
with all these impostors acting
like they own the place.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.660
When CEO Min was dismissed
for all those scandals,

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.100
I imagine that wouldn't have been possible
without your assistance, Lawyer Kim.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.770
I mean, when your boss makes a bad choice,
your duty is to stop them,

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.140
not play along.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.070
Look here, Director Moon Tae Kyung.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.910
Who are you to talk about "bad decisions?"

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.380
From where we're standing,
we're not the ones who are in the wrong.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.510
You are.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.380
Anyone can see you forced out the heir.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.920
The CEO position was assumed legitimately
with the Board of Directors' approval.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.360
You mean the position you got
by threatening the directors?

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.530
If they were afraid of being blackmailed,
they shouldn't have done anything wrong.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.660
Is that simple concept lost on you?

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.560
We'll see who gets the last laugh.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.650
- Are you heading out somewhere?
- I have an appointment.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.920
Is Kyung Chae going out?

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.620
She said she has something to attend to.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.690
Oh, please.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.500
What's a jobless person got to do?

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.500
Goodness, Kyung Chae is
in big trouble now.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.870
She can't just stay unemployed
like this forever.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.370
And it's not like she can get a job
somewhere else.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.810
I know all about it.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.540
My husband was also fired by his father
and was jobless.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.180
How could you compare Ms. Kyung Chae
to the vice director?

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.250
Why shouldn't I?

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.150
You know, I've noticed...

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.480
you have a subtle way
of looking down on my husband.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.550
Ms. Kyung Chae...

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.520
will be back on her feet in no time.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.660
She'll return, reclaim the CEO position,
and become the rightful owner.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.630
Goodness, that's hilarious.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.700
That ship has already sailed.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.900
How could she possibly
go against someone...

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.840
whom the Board of Directors
approved as CEO?

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.210
Are you really saying Father
decided not to change his will?

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.880
It seems so.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.280
How on earth did you manage that?

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.680
Did you threaten him?

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.720
But he's not someone
who'd give in to threats.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.620
That's not what's important right now.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.320
Right now, we have to secure
that will at all costs...

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.960
so that you can become
the acting chairman.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.230
We have to.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.400
How much longer can my father hold
that position?

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.230
We could wait until he passes away,

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.500
or something unexpected could happen
before then.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.370
No matter what happens,

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.010
we must secure your position
as the acting chairman in the will.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.540
Remember, it's the only way we're going
to survive this.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:09.650
Us?

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.650
Yes. Us.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.150
From now on, we're in this together.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.770
Hey there, to all our wonderful
and beloved customers!

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.570
I'm the owner, Oh Pan Sool!

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.170
- How's everything tasting?
- Yes, it's delicious.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.140
Thank you. I hope it's to your liking.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.740
Thank you.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.410
Yeon Ah, now this is personal service.
You should try it too.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.010
What? Me?

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.820
What's the matter? Are you shy?
Feeling embarrassed?

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.450
It's not that.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.850
It's just that
if we wander around like this,

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.090
I'm worried we'll disturb the customers
while they're eating.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.920
- It's not disturbing at all.
- Hey, come over here.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.130
Enjoy your meal.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.860
Stop making a fool of yourself.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.370
You're disturbing our customers
while they eat.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.870
What in the world are you talking about?

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:05.970
Didn't you see them earlier?

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.540
They all said it was great.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.440
They said seeing me
worked up their appetite.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.680
What nonsense is this you're spewing?

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.950
If anyone got a look at your rotten face
while eating a hearty meal,

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.150
it would make them lose their appetite.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.120
I don't know how you can be so clueless
about yourself.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.890
What? "Rotten face?"

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.320
You shriveled-up old bean sprout!

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.260
I'm one of the top three most handsome men
in this neighborhood.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.830
"Shriveled-up old bean sprout?"

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.960
All the good-looking men
must be dead then.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.860
Stay quiet if you don't know anything,
my beautiful wife.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.430
I'm about to be so busy with business...

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.900
that I won't be able to do this
even if I wanted to.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.970
I have a board meeting
at Mingang Distribution,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.470
and I'm arranging a special meeting
about a new investment.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.010
So you're determined to invest more
in stocks?

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.640
You should focus on the Mingang stock
you already have.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.680
I'll handle it, so enjoy
the shamanic ritual show with rice cakes.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.150
I go to church,
so I don't watch those shows.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.690
And I absolutely hate rice cakes.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.250
Fine. Then watch a sermon
and eat some bread.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.430
These are Mingang's cash flow statements
and fund reports from the finance team.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.700
And why do you have these?

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.170
I received a tip.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.170
I didn't think much of it at first,
but I looked into it just in case,

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.070
and I discovered
some suspicious circumstances.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:15.910
"Suspicious circumstances?"

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.310
You'll see discrepancies in the cash flow
statements and the daily fund reports.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.380
This proves someone is embezzling funds
from Mingang.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.190
This can't be the work of just one person.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.790
There must be someone giving the orders...

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.890
and a subordinate on the inside
managing it.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.930
I know what you're implying,
so I'll take it from here.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.200
You don't seem surprised.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.030
I expected you to be furious.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.070
Building Mingang to what it is today,
I've been through far worse than this.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.810
This is hardly surprising.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.140
If, like you said, there's someone
messing around with company money,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.710
I'll just find them and make them pay.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.380
Don't get any more involved.
Stay out of it.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.520
But who's the informant?

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.320
I received an anonymous tip,
so I'm afraid I don't know.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.890
I'll be on my way, sir.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.100
You know, when I was in the States,

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.900
there was an incident where a legal member
whom the owners trusted...

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.230
embezzled the company's dirty money.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.740
It seemed he threatened the chairman,
trying to take him down with him.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.640
Besides, it was dirty money,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.740
so they couldn't report him
or press charges.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.980
The chairman really agonized
over it back then.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.180
Of course, here at Mingang,

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.650
I'm sure nothing like that
would ever happen.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.200
Why is Manager Gong going on
about Kyung Chae...

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.930
getting the CEO position back?

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.970
I almost had a heart attack hearing that.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.970
Manager Gong has always doted
on Kyung Chae.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.240
Anyone who didn't know better would think
they were mother and daughter.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.710
But, darling,
like it or not, Lucia is the CEO now.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.080
That means your entire career
is in her hands.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.420
Yes, pretty much.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.220
Then you need to get on her good side.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.560
You have to impress her now
if you want that promotion.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.290
That's why I'm trying my best
to do just that.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.660
You think just trying hard will work?

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.960
You need a real strategy.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.930
So, what's Soo Jung going to do?
She must have some kind of plan, right?

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.010
Why are you two coming into my room?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.440
What are you going to do now?

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.910
The era of Min Kyung Chae is over,
and Lucia's has begun.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.820
We need to figure out how to survive this.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.750
Figure what out?
We'll just do as we're told.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.520
That's not how it works, Soo Jung.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.960
Both you and my husband's fates
are in her hands now.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.230
So you want us to just suck up to Lucia?

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.600
Suck up? We may have to do
even more than that.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.700
Right now, what Lucia says, goes.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.830
Do you think Father will take our side?

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.700
Even if Lucia kicks us out of the company
like she did with Kyung Chae,

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.270
he wouldn't say a peep.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.340
Just give me a minute.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.580
I'm trying to think
about what we have to do.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.040
For crying out loud!

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.750
How did we get to the point...

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.910
where we're worried about
being kicked out of our company?

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.120
What about Kyung Chae?
Is she just going to take this lying down?

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.420
Do you think she'd actually have
a brilliant plan?

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.360
It's probably just awkward
for her at home,

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.260
so she's just out and about all the time.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.660
There was an incident where a legal member
whom the owners trusted...

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.000
embezzled the company's dirty money.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.570
It seemed he threatened the chairman,
trying to take him down with him.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.570
Besides, it was dirty money,

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.710
so they couldn't report him
or press charges.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.880
The chairman really agonized
over it back then.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.350
Could he mean Lawyer Kim?

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.750
No, that's impossible.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.920
Even if he acts like Kyung Chae's lapdog,

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.790
he doesn't have the guts
to pull something like that on me.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.830
Then again,

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.960
he's the type to make veiled threats,
even to me.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.530
Is he waiting for me to die
to use the will...

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.030
and make Kyung Chae the chairman,

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.800
while he snags a top position for himself?

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.680
Wait a minute...

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.950
But why is the amount so large?

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.350
I'm sure it wasn't this much
when I checked the ledger.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520
Could it be?

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:36.870
Yes, Chairman.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.900
Right now?

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.140
Yes, sir.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.850
You wanted to see me, sir?

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.520
Explain this.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.660
I'm not sure what you want me to explain.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.490
Surely you're not asking
about the discrepancy.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.260
Of course I'm not questioning it.
It was on my orders.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.300
Borrowed-name accounts, false-name shares,

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.830
shell corporations,
the slush fund ledger...

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.610
I told you to embezzle funds by any means
and manage it in absolute secrecy.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:16.970
Those were my instructions.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.880
Then what's this about all of a sudden?

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.180
But when you come to my house
once a month...

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.850
to have me check the slush fund ledger,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.220
I'm certain these weren't the numbers
you showed me.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.120
I may forget other things,
but I never forget numbers.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.260
And I'm telling you,
the numbers were different.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.790
You'd deceive me and cook the books?

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.070
I took a chance on a nobody like you
just because you had a brilliant mind,

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.870
and you'd stab me in the back like this?

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.140
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.680
I even let it slide when you got arrogant
and forgot your place.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.080
But that was only because your loyalty
was to Kyung Chae, not an outsider.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.980
When that brat was after the chairmanship,
instead of trying to stop her,

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.490
you threatened me.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.390
And now you're keeping
a second set of books?

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.690
A second set of books?
That's a ridiculous accusation.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:09.060
We'll see how ridiculous it is
when I check for myself.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:10.990
I'm innocent, Chairman.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.700
How could I dare to betray you
and create a second set of books?

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.100
I was going to let it all go.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.600
Even you trying to put me in a care home,

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.310
and your pathetic threat with the will.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.240
As long as you were managing the ledger,

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.680
I figured keeping you was more useful.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.780
Chairman.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.650
Bring the ledger to me tomorrow.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.150
We'll go through it together,
line by line.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.820
If I find out you've been skimming money,
you'll live to regret it.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.500
How did that sly old fox figure it out?

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.430
What do I do? He seems dead set on this.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.840
If he finds out the truth,
he'd make me disappear without a trace.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.830
(Mingang Distribution)

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.900
Why are you driving so erratically?
It's not like you.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.340
Who are you?

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.940
Where's Mr. Kim?

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.980
Stop the car, now!

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:46.380
Who are you?

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.050
It's me, Chairman.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.930
Just stay still and you won't get hurt.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.960
Turn this car around right now!

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.700
I said, stay still.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.500
Or you're going to get hurt.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.650
You punk...

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.790
Darn it!

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.660
Let me go! Get off me!

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.230
Let go!

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.100
Let me go, you punks!

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.200
What is this? Let go of me, you punks!

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.200
Let go!

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.380
Where are you taking me this time?

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.310
It'd be in your best interest
to come quietly.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.280
If you make a scene, you'll get hurt.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.180
Do you really think
you'll get away with this?

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.350
Let's just go quietly.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.350
- See that he gets there safely.
- Yes, sir!

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.150
You punk! Get your hands off me!

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.590
You punk!

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.410
So long, Min Doo Sik.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.180
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.130
You think I'm going to let this go?

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.130
The day I get out of here,
you're all dead.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.700
That's not going to happen.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.730
You'll live out
the rest of your days here,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.000
and this is where you will die.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.240
Are you going to kick me out
now that the chairman is gone?

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.510
If you don't want to get kicked out,
watch your step.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.040
You think I'm just going to let you be?
Just you wait.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.280
I can't speak for the others,

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.780
but I'm definitely taking you down
with me.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.190
