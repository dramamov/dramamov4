(The Sister Who Returns)

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.399
Sister.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.880
I will uncover the truth of your death.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.560
The man called the Lord of Wujian

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.600
must hold the secret of your death.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:48.439
(Brother.)

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.880
(We have a new game.)

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.320
(I will not let him go.)

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:59.600
(Yan.)

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.399
(Yan.)

00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:04.587
Sister.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:12.959
Sister.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:14.159
(Yan.)

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:32.519
Yan.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.480
I miss you very much.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.680
Will you come with me?

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:44.040
Sister.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.719
Sister.

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.280
Lu Huayan.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.239
Go and reminisce with your sister
in the dream disc.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.960
You inherited
your father's lordship over Wujian.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.879
You do not remain in Wujian properly,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.319
what are you doing here?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.960
Hanging up on brother like that

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.319
is somewhat rude, is it not?

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.840
Did you release the spirit beasts?

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.479
They endanger humans and Wujian's order.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.080
What wicked plan have you set in motion?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.919
The spirit beasts escaped.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.439
You govern poorly yourself,

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.879
so why blame me?

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.560
What does that have to do with me?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.280
That woman at the Paramount
slashed at you.

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.439
I taught her a lesson for you.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.719
I sealed her in the dream disc.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.120
She will die soon.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.759
How amusing.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.919
How will you thank me?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.159
My good brother.

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.439
Li Motong.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.680
I have sealed her in the dream disc.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.680
If you want to free her,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.960
you must kill her.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.520
But if you
slaughter humans indiscriminately,

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.759
you will accept
Wujian's thunder punishment.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.240
This is my gift to you.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.680
A deadly trap.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.680
I really want to see

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.280
how you will make your choice.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.399
Why are you here?

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.519
Did you lure me here
on purpose using my sister's voice?

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:27.480
You want to kill me?

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.199
I have no interest in human lives.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.390
We are both trapped
inside the dream disc.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.439
If you want to leave here alive,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.639
you must work with me.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.399
You monsters.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.240
You killed my sister.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.399
I will never cooperate with you.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.639
If you refuse to work with me,

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:47.439
then you can only die.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.839
Even if it means death,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.920
I will never stand with you.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:52.639
Miss Lu.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600
Only the living have the right
to choose their fate.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.240
The dead can only
be controlled by others.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.560
After so long, the dream realm

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.480
finally welcomes a human.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.399
Let's give them a grand gift.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.360
Miss Shen.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.319
Then let's teach them

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.240
a lesson.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.480
Brother.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.360
I'm truly curious.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.600
Will you really kill this lowly human?

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:39.240
Yan.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.000
Sister.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.839
Sister.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.319
I've finally found you.

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.240
Where have you been?

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.240
I've been waiting every day
for you to come home.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.319
Now I've finally found you.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.839
Then, Yan,

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:07.439
stay by your sister's side forever,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.600
will you?

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.079
All right.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.160
All right.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.319
She isn't your sister at all.

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.079
You're lying.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.279
Your sister has long been dead.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.279
She's just a puppet
inside the dream disc.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.439
Don't be fooled by this illusion.

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:28.839
Lord of Wujian.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.839
You have no right
to interfere between us sisters,

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.199
am I right?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.920
Sister.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.120
What are you doing?

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:53.800
I'll show you now

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.920
what lies beneath the skin

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.000
of the sister you keep calling out for.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.399
Then let's have some fun.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.480
Sister.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.480
Sister!

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.319
Sister!

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:33.680
(We're not done yet.)

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.800
Sister!

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.519
Sister.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.759
Li Motong.

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:46.800
You heartless, bloodthirsty demon.

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:48.920
Even if she was false,

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.879
she was still my only solace.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.920
You shattered my dream
with your own hands.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.439
You've seen the truth.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.600
She's nothing but a puppet
in this dream disc.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.199
If you wish to leave,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.439
then work with me.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.639
I'll lead you out of this dream disc.

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.759
You truly are beyond reason.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.759
Seems I'll have to send you myself.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:24.639
Miss Shen.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.675
