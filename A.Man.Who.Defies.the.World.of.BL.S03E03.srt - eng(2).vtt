00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.300
Alright then,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.330
let's start with a recap of the last episode.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.550
Mister.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.290
Mister.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.060
As for me,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.770
to dodge this age-gap BL flag,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.500
oh, right,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.940
I sent in a handsome grad student

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.490
and flawlessly snapped that flag in two.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.240
Wishing you both happiness,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.950
future lovers.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.360
See?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450
My brilliant maneuver.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.050
A background character through and through.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.510
The king of extras.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.860
Could it be...

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.750
That person... could he be...

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.110
Um...

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.330
Yes?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.160
Um...

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.610
Yes?

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.200
I like you.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.400
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"
(Episode 3)

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.650
VS

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.320
The Confession

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.430
Sorry for the wait.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.430
Oh, it's here. Thanks.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.620
Ah, I'm starving.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.530
Huh? Where's big bro?

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.840
He said he doesn't want to eat.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.480
But it looks so delicious.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.660
- Let's eat.
- Yeah.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.270
- Time to dig in.
- Time to dig in.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.300
I like you.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.540
It's the same as a confession.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.540
It's the most classic flag of all.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.560
Why did that have to happen?

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.220
I like you.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.860
Like...

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480
Yes.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.610
I... I...

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.700
I like you.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.730
Oh, right.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.310
The... the moon...

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.450
What about the moon?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.120
Looks like,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.770
I'll have to play dumb here.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.370
Even when someone's determined to act,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.710
if they stumble right at the start,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.890
it's hard for them to recover right away.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.540
The moon, after all.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.100
It's a lame trick,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.030
but when someone intentionally mishears you like this,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.410
they'll usually say something like,
"Never mind, it's nothing."

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.690
And be forced to retreat.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.500
I like you.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.470
He's not backing down.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840
This guy...

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.000
What's with his nerve?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.780
Um...

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.730
By the way, who are you?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.100
I don't think we've met.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.740
For you to say that so suddenly...

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.820
You don't remember me...

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.750
No.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.240
You don't remember?

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.900
We've met before.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.380
How long ago was that?

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.130
It was...

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.150
eight years ago.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.170
Eight years?

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.380
- No way, that's way too long ago.
- But for me,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.700
I remember it as clearly
as if it happened yesterday.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.350
Eight years ago,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.390
I was in elementary school
and had just gotten a new bike.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.390
I got carried away and rode it really far from home.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.860
Then I fell and the chain came off.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.570
It was getting dark, and I couldn't fix it myself.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.770
I hadn't told my parents I was going so far,

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.380
so I got scared thinking about how I'd get scolded.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.650
As I was crying all by myself...

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.500
It's a long story, so to make it short...

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.840
It seems when I was in middle school,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.390
I helped him out when he was in elementary school.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.710
Ever since then,

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.570
always,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.950
I've liked you.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.900
That's right.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.910
In other words, I...

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.400
It's okay now.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.330
Mister.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.310
Did the same thing in the past.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.000
To break a flag that was raised in the past like this,

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.370
I just need to say the man in his memories isn't me.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.160
But...

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.810
I've always liked you.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.920
There's no way I'd mistake you for someone else.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.430
So it really was me.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.730
The next method I can think of is

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.000
to do something that'll make him hate me, but...

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800
if I do that,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.030
it means I'll have to interact with this
high school kid.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.400
At this point,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.750
all I can do is turn him down normally.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.000
- Um, I'm sorry...
- Then...

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.340
please think about it.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.210
Hey, wait a second.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.960
I can say with certainty,

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.500
this isn't going to end here.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.950
There's bound to be another event
where we meet again.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.920
In this world of BL,

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.060
a flag that's been raised can't just be ignored.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.310
Bro, I'm coming in.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.460
Huh?

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.160
I bought something I thought you might like to eat.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.880
You should eat a little.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.540
It's not good for you to skip meals.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.370
Thanks.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040
Hey, bro.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.080
What were you talking to Hatano about?

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.880
Huh?

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.730
You know Hatano?

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.820
No.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Don't you remember?

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.750
Eight years ago.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.830
Huh?

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.550
Huh? Wait, you two know each other?

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.440
We're in the class next door.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.030
Gross, don't talk with your mouth full.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.570
So,

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.090
what kind of person is this Hatano?

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.450
What kind of person?

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.380
Let me see.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.090
Hatano's a total heartthrob.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.540
Heartthrob.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.870
Yeah.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.360
Hatano's cool.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.610
He's as popular as Tojo.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:40.850
Hello.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.240
Ayato.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.640
Big brother.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.280
About the same as Tojo.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.600
Yeah.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.020
The other day...

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.150
I wonder what they're selling at the canteen today.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.030
Hatano, do you like bread and stuff?

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.670
Well...

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.110
You seem so stylish.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.320
You probably like French toast,
baguettes, or croissants, right?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.240
Hatano.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.110
I like you.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.140
I like you more than anyone.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.270
But unlike Tojo,

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.530
he's super cold and harsh with girls.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.650
Hey, Hatano.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.390
Don't just stand there, say something.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.080
I think you're amazing.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.460
To be able to do this in front of other people,

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.320
to state your feelings so honestly.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.380
Hatano.

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.670
But I...

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.150
can't return your feelings.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.260
That courage of yours

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.260
would be better spent somewhere else
instead of on me.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.270
Hey, Hatano.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.140
It's okay.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.540
Even if I got rejected,

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.330
I'm still glad I got to like him.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.550
Hatano really is...

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.820
so cool and handsome.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.360
Um...

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.590
Those flowers are...

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.690
They symbolize "moving forward,"

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.020
"positivity,"

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.330
and "hope." They're gerbera daisies.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.270
Gerbera daisies.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.150
They're such colorful, beautiful flowers.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840
Hm?

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.600
Oh, no, it's nothing.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.110
So,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.480
why were you talking to Hatano anyway?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.870
Uh...

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.920
He dropped a 100-yen coin,
so I picked it up for him.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.740
What?

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.470
So that's all it was.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.620
Hey.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.510
This is bad.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.700
That was a confession from a main character
who's just as popular as Tojo in this world.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.270
This is...

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.720
a megaton-class flag.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.540
What do I do?

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.520
What should I do?

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.870
Can a background character like me really dodge this flag?

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.180
Oh, but everyone,

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.400
if you see someone in trouble,
you should still help them out.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.530
It's a promise.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:27.990
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.670
I am currently meditating.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:42.460
I hear meditation activates the brain.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.550
And why do I need to activate my brain?

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.040
I like you.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.090
I have to figure something out.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.310
How do I avoid this confession?

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.270
Anyway,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.290
I need to clear my head first.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.060
No, wait.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.580
It's way too hard to clear my head.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.040
That high school kid, Hatano...

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.790
Why would he fall for me just because
I helped him once when he was a kid?

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.510
There must be tons of other adults

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.760
out there who help kids, not just me.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:16.890
I like you.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.770
Like people at the lost and found,

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.250
or daycare teachers.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.940
Is this also...

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.690
a law of the BL world?

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.470
That's right.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.800
Exactly.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.050
This is a BL world.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:42.800
And I completely forgot one of its most basic laws.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.790
I've got it.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.440
A way to dodge the flag.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.190
This is how I'll successfully dodge the flag.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.120
VS

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.770
The Cupid

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.890
Arc

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.620
Oh.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.790
Nagisa.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.430
- Hey, good work today.
- You too.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.860
I've been totally obsessed with this song lately.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.380
Huh?

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:37.380
No way.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.950
I'm obsessed with it too.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.830
Whoa, what a coincidence.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.370
It might not be a coincidence.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.940
- Huh?
- What?

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.570
I've always thought...

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.450
that you two would be perfect for each other.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.610
Huh?

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.370
What are you talking about? Stop messing with us.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.000
I'm not messing with you.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.130
You two...

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.230
just haven't realized your true feelings yet.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.970
What's that guy talking about?

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.150
We're just good friends.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:07.610
Yeah.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.870
Just good friends.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880
So...

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.580
My parents are out of town on a trip today.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.730
Wanna come over to my place?

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.380
Yeah.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.100
You know, you could just stay the night.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.490
Okay.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:44.930
Perfect.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.170
Match successful.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.010
Operation Cupid is a huge success.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:57.910
Just like that,

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.170
with just a little push,

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.610
friendship can easily turn into love.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.270
It's a common occurrence in the BL world.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:13.830
In other words,

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.250
all I have to do is get that long-haired kid, Hatano,

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.820
to fall in love with someone else.
I just have to be his Cupid.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.580
That way,

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.850
I can break the flag that's been planted on me.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.610
I'm home.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.490
What's this...?

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.680
Holding on, holding on, holding on! Yes!

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.240
Passed first place, passed him. Nice!

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.460
Go, go, go!

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.860
Whoa, an item. Crap, they got an item.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.520
This is bad, this is bad.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.290
Welcome.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.450
Hey bro, you're back.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.000
I brought a friend over.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:50.760
You know Hatano, right?

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:51.940
Oh, yeah.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.090
Hello.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.530
Hello.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.290
Um... this is Fumiya.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.090
He's amazing at video games.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.270
Hi, I'm Fumiya.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.500
Sorry to intrude.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.600
Hey there, Fumiya. Make yourself at home.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.340
Okay.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.120
Hey, go faster!

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.140
Come on, come on.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.470
Ayato, nice one!

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.660
Of all the times...

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.720
he brings home a potential partner for Hatano.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.050
Now that it's come to this...

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.710
I'm in first place...

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.700
Hey, you know...

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.820
Hatano and Fumiya actually
look pretty good together, don't they?

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.390
It's a miracle how well you match.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.770
I think you two should just start dating...

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.680
That's enough.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.550
You're the only one I love.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.730
If you still don't get it,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.190
I'll make you understand.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.590
Um... uh...

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.800
I'm so sorry.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:52.770
Right.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.130
That approach is too obvious.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.010
In times like these,

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.230
you just need to give things a subtle nudge.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.440
Go, go!

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.510
Whoa!

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.310
And then I...

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:14.400
I just need to give things a subtle nudge
and wait for my chance.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.760
Hey, Hatano.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:18.540
Aren't you going to cut your hair?

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.760
Isn't it a pain being that long?

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.520
No.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.840
Not really...

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.210
But it's hanging in your face.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.110
- Ayato.
- Yeah?

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.770
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:38.950
Okay.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.520
Having fun?

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.660
Yes.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.270
I see.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.120
Well, have a good time.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.740
Oh.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.330
Hm?

00:16:59.140 --> 00:16:59.680
By the way,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.500
Hatano, your hair is pretty long.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.520
Oh, yes.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.620
Um...

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.400
Does it look weird?

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.310
Oh, no, not weird.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.430
I was just a little worried it might get in your eyes.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.430
I tie it up during class.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.590
So it's fine.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.590
Oh, I see.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.760
It was just a random thought.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.230
Sorry for stopping you.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.580
The characters in this BL world,

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.840
especially the hot guys,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.340
are often very decisive.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.750
If someone mentions "your hair is long,"

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.470
they'll probably go and get it cut the very next day.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:50.950
Hatano.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.440
It's bad for your eyes.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.180
If before I did,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.130
someone else had already asked him
about cutting his hair,

00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.410
what would happen?

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.940
At the very least, Fumiya,
who asked the question first,

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.870
would mistakenly think that Hatano cut his hair
because of what he said.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.260
Then Fumiya...

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.880
would start to take an interest in Hatano.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.750
Once that happens,

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.300
I've succeeded.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.990
This is Operation Cupid.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.380
Ha.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:36.630
And then,

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:37.630
a few days later...

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.860
I'm home. Come on in, come on in.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.980
Sorry to intrude.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.040
That voice is...

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.870
Maybe I should get my hair cut too.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.390
- It's gotten too long lately.
- Then just cut it.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.550
Yes.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.800
Someone got their hair cut.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.320
- Oh, bro, you're here.
- Yeah.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:13.490
Hello.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.620
Huh? He didn't cut it?

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.340
In this kind of situation,

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.920
shouldn't he have chopped it all off?

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.260
By the way, that conversation just now was...

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080
Hello.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.520
Hi, I'm Fumiya.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.410
Hey, bro~

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.770
Why did YOU get a haircut?

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:42.090
And so,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.400
my "pass the flag" operation ended in failure.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.520
My next strategy is...

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.930
Um...

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.600
Um...

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.090
Oh, right.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.880
Hatano said he has something to tell you, bro.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:58.880
Huh?

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840
Um...

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.080
Huh?

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.360
I want to talk to you alone.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.110
What am I supposed to do now?

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.040
What do I do?

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.490
Well, this is an unexpected development.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.130
Alright.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.500
The Gerbera Daisy Prince - My Story with Hatano.
How will it all unfold?

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.000
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.880
I know this is sudden,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.420
but this is my brother's high school festival.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.260
(VS The School Festival Arc)
I love you from the bottom of my heart.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.510
Cinderella.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.480
I'm not Cinderella.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.800
Please call me by my real name.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.880
It's a school festival flag.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.510
Please give me your hand.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.350
You idiot.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.720
That confession...

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.530
(Versus BL Tropes)
Could you please hold off on your answer?

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.850
Because I'm not giving up on you yet.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.760
This is bound to trigger
one classic romantic trope after another.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.290
What am I supposed to do?
I'm just some background character.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.530
What am I supposed to do?
