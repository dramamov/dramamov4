(Qingqing Self-Service Hotpot)

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.660
Take a look.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.960
In just two days,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.520
we will open for business.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.080
I'm sure it won't be long

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.280
before I can reopen Fengyang House.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.120
He Qingqing.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.800
Physician Wang.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.280
What brings you here?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.200
Is it about the medical fee

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.300
that I didn't pay in full?

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.240
Your mother doesn't take the med.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.960
She asked me to tell you

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.240
that

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.440
she must see you once.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.960
Qingqing.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.240
You've come to see me.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.080
You're not angry with me anymore?

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.200
Don't dwell on it too much.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.600
The physician said as long as

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.480
you take the medicine properly

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.520
and nurse yourself.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.920
You can recover fully.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.800
Qingqing.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.960
Do you still remember?

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.200
When you were little, you once said,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.960
when you grew up,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.960
you'd protect your younger brother

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.600
and give the whole family a good life.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.400
I...

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.920
I beg you for one last favor.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.840
Save Datian.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.760
He still owes silver to Wang Cheng.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.600
Help him pay it off first.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.760
I cannot promise you that.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.440
Would you really

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.320
just watch me leave this world

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.640
with regrets

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.320
and watch your brother

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.560
suffer in poverty?

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.400
He Datian ended up like this

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.840
because you kept indulging him.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.920
Instead of guiding him

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.920
to turn back,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.480
you try to guilt-trip me.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.110
You want me to become his second mother?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.160
Qingqing,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.310
I know I owe you.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.920
But I promised your father

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.480
that I would protect Datian

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.760
and keep the He Family bloodline alive.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.400
It means you'll have to
endure the injustice.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.480
In the next life,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.040
I will make it up to you.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.320
No need.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.320
In this life,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.920
I have already chosen my own family.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.320
Qing... Qingqing.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.200
I...

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.480
I owe you an apology.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.280
Just now, my mother asked me,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.920
if I could help look after He Datian.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.520
I turned her down.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.280
I don't hate her.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.560
I could have spoken kindly to her

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.400
but I still said those hurtful words.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.640
Does that make me unfilial?

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.230
You did nothing wrong.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.880
Fu Qinghuai,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
lend me your back.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.440
Mother.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.240
Mother.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.240
No.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880
I must go get a few doses

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.720
for Mother.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.280
I can't even afford fetal medicine now.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.440
How could we pay
for life-preserving medicine?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.840
Do you want to save the elder
or the child?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.440
She's my mother.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.120
Borrow.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.440
I'll borrow some money.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.560
I'll go right now.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.160
Mother.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.600
Take a look at your precious daughter.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.920
You're nearly on your deathbed.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.000
She never came to show any kindness.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.000
And she's dragged our family
into this mess.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.120
It's you.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.880
You're the one who ruined us.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.600
Old woman,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.160
if you hadn't pleaded
again and again back then

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.840
and promised my father a hefty bride price,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.720
he'd never have wed me

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.200
to Datian, that useless man.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.160
And now you want to put the blame on me.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.000
Not a chance.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.440
I want Datian to...

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.560
divorce....

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.160
you.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.040
Mother, you're mistaken.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.840
He would never cast me aside.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.440
Let me share a secret with you.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.720
Truth be told,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.120
I was never with child at all.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.560
You kept an eye on my belly every day.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.320
But now, no matter what I do,

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.280
he follows my lead without question.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.000
You cruel woman!

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600
When it comes down to it,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.000
you're the one who raised

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.400
children with hearts cold as stone.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160
You're the true cause of all this.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.760
Welcome, dear villagers,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.760
thank you for coming
to support my business.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.120
Qingqing, we really owe you our thanks.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.720
You bought our farm produce.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.680
That's why our life

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.600
is getting better.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.120
Yes, exactly.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.400
We're all from the same village.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.920
Helping one another is only right.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.720
Alright, I now make this announcement.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.760
Qingqing self-service hotpot

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.720
is officially open for business!

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.320
Great!

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.040
Qingqing, what is a self-service hotpot?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.600
No need to rush, everyone.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.880
Follow me inside.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.440
You'll see for yourselves.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.880
Honored guests,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.760
anyone who dines here in our shop

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.880
only needs to pay

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.880
a fixed meal price.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.160
Within an hour,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.720
you can eat everything

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.880
you see here to enjoy.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.160
Everything here?

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.350
Of course.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.440
You don't waste food

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.000
then you can eat as much as you like.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.120
We've prepared for everyone

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.160
three types of meal tickets
to choose from.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.720
Each ticket is different

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.600
and offers different limited dishes.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.280
If you can't handle spice,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.400
we've thoughtfully prepared

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.560
a tangy and refreshing tomato soup base

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.480
to make sure everyone eats with ease

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.840
and to your heart's content.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.720
Come to me
if you want to buy meal tickets.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.600
Come, step right up.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600
Sanniang, I want one.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.680
I'll take a tomato hotpot.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.290
Everyone, slow down.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.160
A tomato hotpot.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.000
Easy now, everyone.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.460
(Qingqing Self-Service Hotpot)

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.680
My poor mother-in-law.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.680
You died such a tragic death.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.560
The meal is cooked by that cruel girl.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.960
Yet you actually ate it.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.820
You even dared to.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.200
Aren't you even afraid of bad luck?

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.240
He Datian, what are you doing?

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.780
(In Memory of Madam He)

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.880
What happened to her?

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.800
You still dare to ask?

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.640
It was you.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.320
You knew Mother was gravely ill.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.000
Yet you deliberately spoke to upset her.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.360
You angered her to death.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.400
He Qingqing!

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.960
You owe me Mother's life.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.240
You owe it.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.500
(In Memory of Madam He)

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.360
You have no proof.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.960
Don't go around slandering others.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.880
This is the blood letter she wrote.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.680
Every word says He Qingqing is unfilial.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.360
Look at this, just look.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.320
Judge fairly for my mother-in-law.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.960
Is this true?

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.240
If it really is,

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.560
would we dare eat food

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.960
made by someone like her?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.800
That's right.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.440
Such bad luck.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.640
I lose my appetite.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.200
Qingqing, maybe you should leave first.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.160
I'll hold the line.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.520
Go.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.040
He Qingqing!

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.360
Don't you dare leave.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.080
You must repay me.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.880
You owe me Mother's life.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.280
If you can't repay it,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.240
then give me your restaurant instead.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.000
What now, He Qingqing?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.160
You're gone mute.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.320
Can't say a word?

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.960
She caused my mother-in-law's death.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.120
No wonder she can't speak.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.240
Tell me, how can someone be like that?

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.800
Truly heartless.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.330
Mother.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.680
The dead cannot return.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.080
Please, don't grieve too much.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.200
Come here, Xifeng.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.440
Quick, wipe those tears away.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.120
What is this?

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.560
What's wrong with my eyes?

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.960
Could you have an eye infection?

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.680
This sort of thing can spread to others.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.200
Xu Sanniang!

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.120
Datian, take your wife
to get it treated.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.660
- Or she'll lose her sight.
- Go.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.880
He Qingqing, this isn't over.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.160
Step aside.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.520
Qingqing.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.640
The physician clearly said,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.360
as long as she takes her medicine on time,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.120
her illness wouldn't be fatal.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.800
There's something suspicious about her case.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.240
Don't dwell on it.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.720
By the way,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:21.800
your mother...

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.880
Can she read?

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.360
She cannot read.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.560
Then the blood letter must be a forgery.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.080
But what exactly are they after?

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.080
I'll go check with the He Family.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.840
He Qingqing.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.640
He Qingqing, come out.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.280
Village Chief.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.600
What brings you here?

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.760
That's her. She's the ill-fated star.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.320
That's nonsense.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.280
Qingqing.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.760
Show respect to the Taoist.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.520
Last night, the village archway
was struck by lightning.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.360
It broke off.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.880
So we invited the Taoist

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.440
to divine the cause

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.320
and seek a way to avert the disaster.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.680
Then, the reading pointed to me.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.400
Exactly.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.680
Your unfilial conduct

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.120
caused your mother's passing.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.880
Heaven decreed punishment

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.120
and calamity followed.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.680
If that lightning was brought by me,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.760
why didn't it just strike me down?

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.560
The Heaven spares life where they can.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.640
They gave you a chance
to mend your ways.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.760
But if you remain stubborn,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.800
even immortals won't be able to save you.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.640
Taoist,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.000
is there any way
to undo this misfortune?

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.800
This matter isn't that difficult.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.440
She must guard the spirit

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.560
before her mother's memorial tablet

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.360
and seek forgiveness

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.360
from her mother.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.360
Qingqing,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.440
it's just keeping vigil, nothing more.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.320
I'm speaking to you kindly now.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.440
Don't let this spiral out of control.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.040
Alright.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.800
I'll go with you.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.240
(Next Episode)
He Qingqing.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.010
You caused Mother's death.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:43.720
You dare to come?

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.440
The Widow Star harms both mother and kin.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.360
It will bring great disaster

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.560
upon the entire village.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.600
Only by cutting flesh to repay her mother

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.840
can the crisis be resolved.

and without anyone noticing,

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.120
you tampered with the final letter.
