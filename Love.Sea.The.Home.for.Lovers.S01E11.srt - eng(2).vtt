WEBVTT

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.050
My life

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.280
has always been shrouded in fear.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.350
Fear of pain.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.350
Fear of love.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.740
Fear of happiness.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.360
Despite that, I met him

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.110
he taught me something very important.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.430
Good

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.430
I've confirmed it.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.320
Wow, I didn't expect to get this so soon.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.400
Whom do you have to thank for that?

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.550
Someone you rushed work for

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.390
and desperately want to see?

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.410
- You are absolutely right.
- You bet...

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.950
However...

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.700
you can work anywhere

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.180
why not finish it on the island?

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.260
No way.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.040
The first few days after getting home

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.720
I'll stick to that guy in bed.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.430
There's no way to work.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.820
Home...

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.340
Hmm?

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.780
Nothing.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.430
Although you stay in the city for half of year

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.470
you still call the island "home".

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.350
Yeah.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.030
It's more like...

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.270
he's my home.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.840
Wherever he is

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.190
it's my home.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200
Well then...

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.840
I'm heading home now.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.210
See you around.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.330
Get good rest.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.080
My home...

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.190
Where is it?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.200
Cut! That's a wrap!

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.780
Great job.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.080
Thank you, everyone.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.360
Huh?

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.790
Leaving already?

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.570
My scenes aren't finished yet.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.380
Let's all go out for dinner when it's done

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.790
then we can hit a dart bar until dawn

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.590
I'll pass.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.740
You can take my place to get snapped by the tabloids.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.220
I'm going home to pack.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.830
What? Where are you going?

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.530
Two weeks starting tomorrow

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.280
I'm going on vacation.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.010
Seriously? That's awesome!

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.610
Bring me back a souvenir...

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.770
No way.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.020
It's a waste to spend time on vacation thinking about coworkers.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.900
So cold!

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.010
Good work today.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.680
Here, this is for you.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.540
I bought it at the food truck during a break.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.110
Let's eat together at home.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.740
Okay.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.040
Thank you.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.190
Hey.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.660
We're a couple now. You can relax a little.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.960
A couple...

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.200
It isn't like that.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.720
Oh.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.970
We are life supporting partners.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.220
If you keep panicking, you're going to crash...

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.870
Deep breaths.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.580
So cute.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.400
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Special Episode 1)

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.870
Long time no see, I'm about to dry up.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.570
Oh, is it still just getting close?

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.160
No, I've completely withered.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.740
All shriveled up and dry~.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.240
Kaishin~.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.580
Ah, this makes me want to fall in love...

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.030
You're teasing me again.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.140
Do you really want to see me?

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.040
Is there a stronger phrase to say
"I want to see you"?, Mr. Writer.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.010
Any comparison would still include its own words.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.470
So, "I want to see you" is enough.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.250
You're also teasing me.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.840
You just wait.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.350
It's not scary at all.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.050
Oh, I can be very scary.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.600
What do you want me to do?

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.450
I want to see you.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.530
How much?

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.110
When "I want to see you" isn't enough

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.540
what should I say?

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.490
I want to see you desperately.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.190
I want to wake up next to you.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.990
Dude.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.110
Are you really gonna pay me?

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.350
I'll pay you, be quick, don't stop.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.740
Not next month, not even tomorrow.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.850
Ai-san is coming back today.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.930
Alright, alright.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.020
What is this?

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.050
It's all "Ugh"

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.690
and "Ah."

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.410
Oh.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.410
It's for a bed scene.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800
Huh?

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.200
He asked me to check it for him.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.220
A tanned, burly man from the island

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:41.960
takes a pale, scrawny city boy home from a bar.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.660
I feel like something like this has happened before.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.610
Is this your bed scene, dude?

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.380
You're a lucky guy, Ham.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.130
You get a sneak peek at an unpublished work
before the readers.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.370
"His sparkling eyes"

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.250
"were not just intimidating,"

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.090
"but also incredibly gentle and sweet."

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.280
That doesn't sound like you at all, dude.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.650
Go clean.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.420
Not you, dude.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.140
Go clean.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.340
Ah, so beautiful.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.540
What's the rush?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.870
Because I'm going to see the person I love.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.930
The person you love...

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.600
In a country where same-sex marriage isn't recognized,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.160
is there any other way to put it?

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.320
Marriage?

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.670
Coming from Ai?

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.840
People change.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.540
Unlike a certain someone,

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.810
who's been running in place for a year.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.010
At this rate, you'll just get older and older.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.540
Isn't that pathetic?

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.240
So pathetic.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.480
Even Ai-sensei is ganging up on me.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.350
Ai-san.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.150
I missed you so much.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.390
You were just here a month ago...

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:16.950
I'm back.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.110
What took you so long?

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.910
These two kept taking detours.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.900
They made us miss our ferry.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.420
People really do change. Such a tattletale.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.760
Say something.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.370
Did you forget something?

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.080
I'm still waiting.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.730
Ai-san is back.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.020
Welcome back.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.030
Are they treating us like we're invisible?

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.180
This little tattletale is so cute.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.790
Let's go.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.630
To our island.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.340
Tired?

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.780
Dealing with them was more exhausting than the travel.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.210
They're so difficult.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.580
I'm completely drained.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.230
Kaishin.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.750
What do you want from me?

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.120
Such a spoiled adult.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.890
And a tattletale, too.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.700
But I only tattle to you.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.990
Isn't that great?

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.490
For sun protection.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.440
A gift.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.940
Do you like it?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.650
I love anything you give me, Ai-san.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.330
Most importantly,

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.640
I'm just so happy you thought of me.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:05.730
Thank you.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.380
I'll cherish it.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:14.810
So?

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.050
Where do you want to go tomorrow?

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.930
Isn't it obvious?

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.390
Move your bangs.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.400
How's this?

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.010
The cutest in the world.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.570
I know.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.010
And handsome.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.450
Also,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.880
very sexy.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.090
Hey, what are you two doing?

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.320
Are you going to be all lovey-dovey?

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.720
Or are we going diving?

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.130
Can't we do both?

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:24.810
Fumi.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.920
Himeka-san.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.530
Please get dressed.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.510
This isn't your house.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.990
I only have eyes for you, Fumi.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.620
Where's Ai?

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.010
He went out with Kaishin.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:45.950
He said they'd be back late.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.620
So we're on our own for dinner.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.550
Ditching his best friend during their trip together.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:53.730
Well...

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.820
They've been looking forward to some alone time.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.950
Are you taking their side, Fumi?

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.910
No, that's not it.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.500
I just like seeing them together.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.600
Because Sensei looks so happy.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.660
What about me?

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.030
I was happy when I was with Fumi, too.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.860
By the way,

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.640
while I'm on this island,

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.680
I'm going to keep going after Fumi.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.480
So you'd better be ready.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.570
Delicious.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.320
Ahh...

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.030
You do it.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.630
Feed me.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.950
It tastes better that way.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.880
Please.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:57.490
Is it good?

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.330
Delicious.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.870
Are you happy?

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.460
Are you talking about the snorkeling, or the kiss?

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.260
About being back at our home.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.110
How did you know?

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.090
Because the first thing you always do
when you're back on the island is go diving.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.000
Diving makes you feel like you're home.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.880
Yeah.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.240
So, when I come home,

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.690
guess what comes to mind?

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.230
Me.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.370
Close enough.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.150
The sight of you swimming, Kaishin.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.720
This ocean is your home, isn't it?

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.760
Since it's the place you love and belong to,

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.660
I want to love it too.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.200
Try saying it.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.610
Because I...

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:10.920
love you.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:14.750
Hold me.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.310
Quick.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.900
Hey, hurry up.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:28.230
Well then.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.480
Shouldn't we head back to our home?

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.670
Not yet.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.700
There's somewhere I want to take you.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.960
- Can I open my eyes yet?
- Nope.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.310
- You like this, don't you?
- I do.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.450
You peeked just now, didn't you?

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.530
No, I didn't.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.240
Okay.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.480
We're almost there.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.370
You can open your eyes now.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.850
- I can open them?
- Yeah.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.480
It's beautiful.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.780
Hey, guys.

00:18:41.122 --> 00:18:41.890
Hey, don't tell me you're
a "million tapes" too.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.090
So beautiful.

00:18:44.441 --> 00:18:45.940
What the hell is a million tapes?

00:18:45.964 --> 00:18:47.870
Have you guys heard from Big, the producer?

00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:50.011
About what?

00:18:50.304 --> 00:18:52.326
We're going to have a concert!

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:53.170
Shit.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.370
It hasn't changed at all.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.171
Hm?

00:18:56.171 --> 00:18:57.590
Then I must be "Ek, two million tapes".

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.610
It's nothing.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.730
Here.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.510
Want some of the lunch I made?

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.840
I do.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.350
Oh, but...

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.390
We'll have to disinfect with seawater again.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.510
I brought wet wipes.

00:19:10.895 --> 00:19:13.537
Finally, a big concert.

00:19:13.562 --> 00:19:14.310
Let's do it.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.041
Ahh...

00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:16.384
Chai, with this good news,

00:19:16.409 --> 00:19:16.670
should we go celebrate?

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.670
Ah.

00:19:18.474 --> 00:19:18.840
Celebrate?

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.600
Today was the best day ever.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.001
I want to celebrate with you.

00:19:22.326 --> 00:19:22.770
But I'm not free today.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:23.770
The scenery,

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:24.759
the food,

00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:25.759
Oh.

00:19:25.835 --> 00:19:26.580
Then where are you going?

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.580
And?

00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:29.864
Come on, it's an important matter.

00:19:29.927 --> 00:19:33.034
But just don't follow me.

00:19:35.095 --> 00:19:37.535
Just don't follow me, okay?

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.211
I told you not to follow me.

00:19:43.374 --> 00:19:44.535
Go inside the house.

00:19:54.796 --> 00:19:56.096
You're still not in the house.

00:19:56.582 --> 00:19:57.609
Go on.

00:20:25.094 --> 00:20:26.520
It's so amazing.

00:20:26.544 --> 00:20:28.819
I never thought a small
band could come this far.

00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:31.670
True, I'm so happy.

00:20:36.508 --> 00:20:38.148
Are there a lot of mosquitoes in England?

00:20:38.512 --> 00:20:39.840
Probably not many.

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:41.873
"Not many" means there are some.

00:20:48.476 --> 00:20:51.416
And how cold is it in England?

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.635
It's colder than here.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.523
But it mostly rains more.

00:20:59.107 --> 00:21:00.834
So you'll need a raincoat.

00:21:04.588 --> 00:21:06.201
That's too much, Biu.

00:21:09.104 --> 00:21:11.666
And are the tickets very expensive?

00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:15.700
They are expensive, and
you still need to get a visa.

00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:18.098
Why, are you going to follow me?

00:21:18.122 --> 00:21:19.122
Nope.

00:21:19.308 --> 00:21:20.757
If I were as rich as Ek,

00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:22.812
I'd buy a plane and fly after you.

00:21:23.437 --> 00:21:24.729
You're exaggerating.

00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:27.579
Just the thought of you coming with me,

00:21:28.164 --> 00:21:29.518
I'm already happy.

00:21:30.942 --> 00:21:33.056
So, when are you flying, Lin?

00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:35.242
Will you be here for the concert?

00:21:36.708 --> 00:21:38.384
The day after the concert.

00:21:38.415 --> 00:21:39.898
Hey, that's great.

00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:41.453
I thought I'd have to watch it alone.

00:21:50.812 --> 00:21:53.782
I thought you said you weren't free to
celebrate with your friends.

00:21:54.127 --> 00:21:56.280
But you're here with
me, just the two of us.

00:21:56.647 --> 00:21:58.134
I can only think of bad things.

00:22:00.103 --> 00:22:01.297
You're thinking right.

00:22:02.294 --> 00:22:03.367
Thinking right?

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.962
Thinking right about what?

00:22:06.262 --> 00:22:07.688
Do you know what I'm thinking?

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.051
Well, that I want to celebrate
with just the two of us.

00:22:13.077 --> 00:22:14.637
Or were you thinking of something else?

00:22:16.929 --> 00:22:18.755
No, I was...

00:22:19.469 --> 00:22:21.315
I was thinking what you were thinking.

00:22:26.632 --> 00:22:29.735
I wrote a song.

00:22:31.044 --> 00:22:32.564
I want you to be the first to hear it.

00:22:43.399 --> 00:22:46.826
♪ Remember the first day we met? ♪

00:22:46.851 --> 00:22:50.963
♪ It's still so clear in my heart. ♪

00:22:56.739 --> 00:23:00.298
♪ You came and the whole city changed. ♪

00:23:00.322 --> 00:23:04.531
♪ The whole world became bright. ♪

00:23:09.804 --> 00:23:13.067
♪ You changed me into a different person. ♪

00:23:13.092 --> 00:23:16.279
♪ Did you cast a spell or a magic charm? ♪

00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:18.869
♪ That makes the stars in the sky ♪

00:23:18.893 --> 00:23:24.770
♪ seem worthless when you're by my side. ♪

00:23:29.888 --> 00:23:31.008
Do you like it?

00:23:31.128 --> 00:23:32.128
Yes.

00:23:34.385 --> 00:23:35.551
Like the song?

00:23:36.437 --> 00:23:37.704
Or like me?

00:23:42.032 --> 00:23:43.345
Both.

00:24:10.434 --> 00:24:11.554
Mmm..

00:24:13.437 --> 00:24:14.531
Can I ask you something?

00:24:15.488 --> 00:24:16.488
What?

00:24:17.874 --> 00:24:19.467
About the two of us,

00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:23.317
should I tell my dad?

00:24:25.287 --> 00:24:26.454
And the fans too.

00:24:27.817 --> 00:24:28.824
Or...

00:24:31.168 --> 00:24:32.710
should we keep hiding it like this?

00:24:38.085 --> 00:24:40.358
I think your dad

00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:42.578
probably already knows.

00:24:43.813 --> 00:24:46.408
He just might not be able to say much.

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:50.207
Then let's tell him later.

00:24:50.813 --> 00:24:52.768
For now, let your dad play dumb.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.574
"Play dumb"?

00:24:56.317 --> 00:24:57.597
Is that a new word?

00:24:58.121 --> 00:24:59.262
It's easy to understand.

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:05.055
And what about the fans?

00:25:09.729 --> 00:25:10.770
With the fans,

00:25:12.038 --> 00:25:14.542
I think in this era,

00:25:15.489 --> 00:25:16.625
it's better not to yet.

00:25:17.742 --> 00:25:19.069
Yeah, I think so too.

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:23.080
But you talk like we can
reveal it in another era.

00:25:26.793 --> 00:25:28.066
Want to bet?

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:32.752
In about another 20 years,

00:25:34.802 --> 00:25:36.429
our love

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.412
will have everyone's support.

00:25:39.652 --> 00:25:41.342
And our marriage

00:25:42.209 --> 00:25:43.650
will be legal too.

00:25:45.673 --> 00:25:46.812
Are you kidding?

00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:50.680
So to know the result,

00:25:52.235 --> 00:25:53.734
we have to wait another 20 years?

00:25:54.843 --> 00:25:55.964
Why?

00:25:55.989 --> 00:25:57.790
Are you not going to
be with me for 20 years?

00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:00.119
No way.

00:26:01.212 --> 00:26:02.813
40 years is too short.

00:26:04.151 --> 00:26:05.471
Then,

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.643
what does the loser have to do?

00:26:12.773 --> 00:26:14.210
The loser has to

00:26:15.163 --> 00:26:18.340
stay with the winner for another 60 years.

00:26:20.069 --> 00:26:21.179
Wow.

00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:23.500
That's serious.

00:26:24.805 --> 00:26:26.833
I thought you said 40 years was too short.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.401
Deal?

00:26:52.923 --> 00:26:54.263
Thank you all so much.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.765
For always risking danger with me.

00:26:58.082 --> 00:26:59.781
We should be the ones thanking you.

00:26:59.812 --> 00:27:01.019
For not leaving us.

00:27:02.901 --> 00:27:04.067
Then today,

00:27:05.331 --> 00:27:06.771
we will fight with dignity,

00:27:07.963 --> 00:27:09.803
like it's our last battle.

00:27:10.813 --> 00:27:11.535
Let's do it.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.128
- Let's do it!
- Let's go!

00:27:13.153 --> 00:27:13.870
Let's do it.

00:27:13.895 --> 00:27:16.323
1, 2, 3, go!

00:27:17.973 --> 00:27:19.540
What are you guys going to fight?

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.004
Who the hell is that?

00:27:23.612 --> 00:27:25.145
I told you not to follow me.

00:27:25.965 --> 00:27:27.325
Are you going to get into a fight?

00:27:28.177 --> 00:27:29.697
It's called the final battle.

00:27:30.712 --> 00:27:32.480
I'm going to fight Thoed for the last time.

00:27:33.447 --> 00:27:34.933
So we can settle this.

00:27:35.386 --> 00:27:36.662
So the story can end.

00:27:37.112 --> 00:27:39.938
Is this the last thing
that's bothering you?

00:27:40.332 --> 00:27:42.121
The reason you're not ready to be with me?

00:27:42.891 --> 00:27:43.891
Yes.

00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:46.070
As long as Thoed's gang

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.272
is still bullying my guys,

00:27:49.352 --> 00:27:50.800
you won't be safe.

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:53.571
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

00:27:54.662 --> 00:27:56.385
That's why I have to clear this up today.

00:27:58.119 --> 00:27:59.812
So the reason you won't be with me

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:01.865
is because of this little thing?

00:28:03.989 --> 00:28:05.424
It's not just a little thing.

00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:07.428
- Thoed's gang...
- Wait a minute, Chai.

00:28:08.283 --> 00:28:09.795
If it's because of this little thing,

00:28:10.262 --> 00:28:11.697
you should have told me sooner.

00:28:32.115 --> 00:28:34.701
Hey, have you seen Chai's gang?

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.601
Do you guys have a problem with Chai?

00:28:43.382 --> 00:28:45.009
He likes to start trouble with us.

00:28:45.856 --> 00:28:47.013
Is that all?

00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:48.226
Yeah.

00:28:49.348 --> 00:28:52.453
Then if both sides stop starting trouble,

00:28:52.477 --> 00:28:53.853
the matter will be over, right?

00:28:54.317 --> 00:28:55.431
Yes.

00:28:56.495 --> 00:28:57.895
Then from this day on,

00:28:57.919 --> 00:28:59.426
the Red Hawk gang will
stop starting trouble with you.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.778
And you guys will stop starting trouble
with the Red Hawk gang.

00:29:01.802 --> 00:29:02.828
Is it over?

00:29:03.182 --> 00:29:05.422
What are you talking
about? Are you asking us to...

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.653
Uh... actually, it can be over.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:24.685
Right, guys?

00:29:24.812 --> 00:29:26.495
- Yes, yes.
- I agree.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.867
- Let's go, it's over.
- I have other things to do.

00:29:29.127 --> 00:29:30.500
Is it really over?

00:29:31.702 --> 00:29:33.135
Yeah, really.

00:29:33.508 --> 00:29:35.221
We keep our word.

00:29:35.514 --> 00:29:36.715
Right, guys?

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.285
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.689
We keep our word.

00:29:44.445 --> 00:29:45.565
Let's go.

00:30:05.096 --> 00:30:06.096
Mom.

00:30:08.479 --> 00:30:09.996
I'm having a concert.

00:30:11.224 --> 00:30:12.557
Do you want tickets?

00:30:13.757 --> 00:30:14.757
Yes.

00:30:21.636 --> 00:30:22.996

The matter with Thoed's gang is over.

00:32:16.947 --> 00:32:19.454
So can we be together now?

00:32:28.017 --> 00:32:29.277
I've been...

00:32:31.936 --> 00:32:33.256
waiting for this for a long time.

00:32:47.649 --> 00:32:48.649
Here.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.447
I'm returning this as promised.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.255
Then I'll be going now.

00:33:10.935 --> 00:33:12.306
Wait, Biu.

00:33:21.192 --> 00:33:22.605
I think

00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:25.679
I like you too, Biu.

00:33:27.207 --> 00:33:29.440
I don't know if you still like me now.

00:33:29.815 --> 00:33:33.455
But if you're still single when
I get back from England...

00:34:01.677 --> 00:34:03.480
60 years isn't enough.

Talk to me like this...

00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:16.495
do we know each other?

00:35:16.727 --> 00:35:18.127
Shit.

00:35:18.947 --> 00:35:20.121
You!

00:35:22.193 --> 00:35:23.393
I just wanted to invite you...

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.569
Hey!

00:35:24.594 --> 00:35:25.594
Ouch!

00:35:29.701 --> 00:35:30.908
Is this your friend's?

00:35:32.842 --> 00:35:33.842
Nut.

00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:37.723
You dropped your wallet.

00:35:46.533 --> 00:35:48.012
Should we start a band?

00:35:57.554 --> 00:35:58.460
Ek.

00:35:58.485 --> 00:35:59.442
Ek, wait.

00:35:59.467 --> 00:36:00.467
Ek.

00:36:00.556 --> 00:36:01.596
About the band, Ek.

00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:02.621
Win.

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.309
I think you should meet the doctor.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.229
I probably just didn't eat enough.

00:36:13.821 --> 00:36:15.374
Here, I made this for you.

00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:17.893
So you can eat all your meals.

00:36:18.004 --> 00:36:19.525
So you won't faint again.

00:36:19.828 --> 00:36:21.300
So tired.

00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:24.956
Nut.

00:36:25.143 --> 00:36:26.596
Nut.

00:36:26.888 --> 00:36:27.897
Are you okay?

00:36:28.624 --> 00:36:30.205
You have to sleep now, you know.

00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:31.743
Just like the doctor ordered.

00:36:32.372 --> 00:36:33.585
Is that all you called for?

00:36:36.053 --> 00:36:37.077
Good night.

00:36:39.483 --> 00:36:41.051
We're close to the competition.

00:36:41.075 --> 00:36:42.978
So I want to practice a little more.

00:36:45.406 --> 00:36:46.526
Is that all?

00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:50.319
I wanted to talk to you alone.

00:36:59.215 --> 00:37:00.467
Why are you running?

00:37:00.491 --> 00:37:02.083
You're going to faint again.

00:37:02.756 --> 00:37:04.391
If I feel unwell,

00:37:04.415 --> 00:37:06.080
I'll tell you first.

00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:09.113
Stop worrying about me.

00:37:09.549 --> 00:37:12.296
And, did you get a new haircut?

00:37:15.115 --> 00:37:16.194
This style

00:37:17.387 --> 00:37:18.527
is pretty cute too.

00:37:21.766 --> 00:37:23.734
I used to think that I
wanted to have a band,

00:37:25.683 --> 00:37:27.402
and invite everyone to go camping,

00:37:28.015 --> 00:37:30.055
to sit and eat moo krata
like this for a long time.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.407
You're like you know my heart.

00:37:35.687 --> 00:37:37.328
We only have one tent?

00:37:37.353 --> 00:37:38.353
Yes.

00:37:38.903 --> 00:37:40.350
Win, you can sleep with me.

00:37:46.995 --> 00:37:48.019
Good night.

00:37:51.065 --> 00:37:54.487
What's wrong with you lately?

00:37:54.952 --> 00:37:57.392
Suddenly you're being unusually nice to me.

00:38:00.659 --> 00:38:01.659
And you?

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.849
A while ago you were being
unusually nice to me too.

00:38:23.477 --> 00:38:24.617
What now?

00:38:25.843 --> 00:38:27.258
Want to sleep in my room?

00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:11.616
I don't have to do anything.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.710
Hey.

00:39:12.896 --> 00:39:14.498
You better watch out.

00:39:14.522 --> 00:39:15.910
There's a gangster around here.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:17.805
What?

00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:19.325
You better hide well.

00:39:20.384 --> 00:39:21.957
Dang Bireley.

00:39:21.982 --> 00:39:24.438
Wowww...

00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:29.980
Do you know why this is called popcorn?

00:39:30.005 --> 00:39:30.873
Why?

00:39:30.898 --> 00:39:32.533
Because Popeye is a cartoon.

00:39:38.617 --> 00:39:40.837
You forgot to zip your pants.

00:39:47.168 --> 00:39:48.608
This is almost finished.

00:39:59.695 --> 00:40:01.009
What?

00:40:01.034 --> 00:40:02.590
We have to be still.

00:40:06.956 --> 00:40:09.028
Everyone, smile and laugh.

00:40:09.053 --> 00:40:10.663
Hey, he's going for the handsome way.

00:40:12.477 --> 00:40:14.307
That's more like it, guys.

00:40:14.332 --> 00:40:15.840
He's going to break.

00:40:15.865 --> 00:40:17.428
Don't pretentious.

00:40:19.694 --> 00:40:20.921
Don't pretentious.

00:40:23.191 --> 00:40:25.337
Everyone, this is Lin.

00:40:26.266 --> 00:40:27.572
My friend from middle school.

00:40:28.045 --> 00:40:31.575
Lin, this is Win, our lead singer.

00:40:32.602 --> 00:40:33.648
This is Ek...

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.791
This is Chai, the drummer.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.817
This is Ek, the guitarist.

00:40:43.532 --> 00:40:45.387
And this is Biu, the bassist.

00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:48.721
This scene is so messed up.

00:40:54.024 --> 00:40:56.264
I wish I could play the drums forever.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:58.703
Forever?

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.257
Yes.

00:41:02.846 --> 00:41:03.920
Nut.

00:41:12.947 --> 00:41:13.947
Come here.

00:41:15.535 --> 00:41:16.955
Don't you want to be brave?

00:41:23.308 --> 00:41:25.035
Hey, this guy.

00:41:28.769 --> 00:41:31.249
Not yet, still haven't cut.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.643
Opal is posing like this.

00:41:40.676 --> 00:41:41.964
I think,

00:41:42.863 --> 00:41:44.077
I like Nut.

00:41:49.779 --> 00:41:51.479
I want to confess my love.

00:41:52.089 --> 00:41:53.962
Can you find the right moment for me, Win?

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:59.490
Of course, Lin.

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.540
Before you confess your love to Nut,

00:42:04.173 --> 00:42:06.110
don't forget to order the chocolate sundae

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.047
with lots of chocolate sprinkles.

00:42:08.477 --> 00:42:09.555
Oh, and also,

00:42:09.833 --> 00:42:11.993
don't order more than 1
bowl, he'll get a stomachache.

00:42:12.181 --> 00:42:14.270
I'm done, I'm going to bed.

00:42:14.705 --> 00:42:17.281
Hey, where are you going? Wait.

00:42:18.368 --> 00:42:20.925
If the ghost is drunk, then ghunk is drost

00:42:22.662 --> 00:42:24.042
"ghunk is drost."

00:42:25.393 --> 00:42:26.483
What is that?

00:42:26.508 --> 00:42:28.490
I don't know either.

00:42:34.781 --> 00:42:36.675
No one is helping me.

00:42:50.042 --> 00:42:51.429
- Does it hurt?
- It hurts.

00:42:56.516 --> 00:42:57.703
Win.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.701
Actually, you like Nut too, right?

00:43:04.524 --> 00:43:05.954
Whether I like him or not,

00:43:06.938 --> 00:43:08.500
it doesn't matter, Lin.

00:43:10.607 --> 00:43:12.830
Anyway, right nhow~

00:43:19.977 --> 00:43:21.335
Hey, do you see this, Opal?

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.815
Where is this person from?
