This is the second time
you've used my mom to threaten me.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.690
In a moment, a car will pull up outside.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.540
You'll leave in that car.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.260
I called the shots to start this play.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.820
And I'll be the one to end it.

has already been caught.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.940
Now the Major General suspects
he's linked to Director Lee.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.570
Director Lee needs to
head to Yuyin Pavilion

who asked me to come?

Why don't I hear his voice anywhere?

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.140
The Major General got an urgent call.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.140

Mr. Lee.

The man on stage has confessed.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.980
He says you're with the Communist Party

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.540
and that you're working together.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.660

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.540

Let's end the storm
with just the two of us.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.220
I'm a member of the Communist Party

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.020
and an agent

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.700

Joseph Lee.

Shanghai Underground Communist Party.

He's the leader of our squad.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.900
I never meant to betray anyone.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.660
But I don't want to die.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.900
It's absurd.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.900
A meeting spot? What's the point?

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.370
We met at Yuyin Pavilion six months ago.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.020
Later, you told me
things were getting risky,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.580
and that we should change the spot.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.460
So we went to the backstage
at the Chaosheng Troupe.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.900
The Chaosheng Troupe?

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.220
Did Xian Biyun know about it?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.180
I have no idea.
We only had one-way contact.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.490
My only contact was Joseph Lee.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.730
I really don't know anything else.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.420
What about Charlie Gu?

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.100
Charlie Gu was a known traitor.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.650
I told you that long ago,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.420
stop letting him be around you
all the time.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.940
I said he might be

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.180
a spy placed next to you
by the Japanese.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.460
I really don't know.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.420
What scene are you playing at now?

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.340
Can I sit
and wait for the Major General?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.060
Hey.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.580
Yes.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.700
Get him a chair.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.460
Yes.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.460
Bring a chair over.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.300
Yes.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.850
How did the Major General know
he was anti-Japanese?

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.610
To steal the codebook
for the secure radio

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.340
of the Pacification Committee,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.340
he killed the Major General's only son.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.100
That makes it even more absurd.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.580
All of you know

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.180
I was never involved

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.850
in the Pacification Committee's work.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.490
So how could I possibly know

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.940
about this so-called codebook

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.490
and whose hands it's in?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.340
Luo, my friend,

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.490
making up stories takes skill.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.420
Captain Lee,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.820
our organization has strict rules.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.220
I'm not allowed to ask how you knew

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.580
the codebook was with Hashimoto.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.580
You told me to take out Hashimoto.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.730
But he was Sasaki's son.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.180
Sasaki would rather
kill a thousand by mistake

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.820
than let one target slip away.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.610
Let's just...admit it.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.100
Once we do, each of us
will have a way to survive.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.980
Alright?

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.610
Hashimoto...

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.730
The Major General has a son?

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.340
Coming.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.820
Coming.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.460
All the noise.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.820
Like the sound's chasing your life away.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.980
Commissioner Gu, what's going on?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.980
Is Mr. Liang in? I need to see him.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.300
He's been busy all night
and just fell asleep.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.490
What's so urgent?
I can pass the message.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.300
I have to tell him face to face.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.300
Why are you being like this?

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.850
Let Commissioner Gu come up.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.700
You sure Ding Yi was taken
to Yuyin Pavilion?

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.610
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.580
Looks like in the end,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.730
we're getting blamed
for Sasaki's son's death.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.820
We just meant to throw the heat
on someone else,

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.580
but ended up lighting the whole armory.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.460
Liang, Liang.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.220
Sorry to interrupt your rest.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.980
Make yourself comfortable.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.060
If I remember correctly,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.890
this foreign-owned radio station
was listed

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.580
as one of the enemy stations.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.060
Ain't it weird listening to it
so loud in public?

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.580
You're my friend and I trust you.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.300
Liang, I don't see it that way.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.700
Contacting Chongqing is a big deal.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.490
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.610
Miss Megumi.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.700
May I have a word with you in private?

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.340
Your leg's healed?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.490
Looks like we've met before.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.580
That's good, saves us the introductions.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.300
Miss Megumi.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.980
I'd like to ask you to help Joseph.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.940
Since the war began,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.340
the sugar price in Chongqing

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.460
has soared over three hundred times.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.700
But just a few months ago,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.700
the Sugar Procurement Committee
in Chongqing

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.980
received a donation,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.100
a batch of imported
sugar production machinery.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.700
Really?

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.700
Of course.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.940
It instantly solved the technical issues

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.180
for all sugar mills
near Sichuan and Guizhou.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.580
But according to insider news,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.420
the donor is from Shunde,
Guangdong province, surname Ye.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.700
If I'm not mistaken,

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.100
isn't that your in-law's family?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.700
The Ye Family from Shunde, Guangdong.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.060
That's right.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.340
But there are many people
named Ye in Shunde.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.580
You're not suspecting my wife, are you?

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.460
Liang, you still don't see me
as a real friend.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.610
Not telling me the truth.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.220
Why would people
from the Ministry of Economy

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.980
and the Finance Committee

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.940
return to Chongqing
and privately lobby for you?

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.980
And there's one more thing.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.940
Only the BIS refuses to back down,

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.580
because you blew up
a liaison point of Shanghai BIS.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.300
I'm a member
of the Pacification Committee.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.340
Let's not bring up the past.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.100
But Liang,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.220
you should think about
your wife's family.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.980
The Ye Family spent a fortune

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.220
for you to get this seat.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.420
It was a hefty amount.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.730
If you plan to keep climbing higher,

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.700
can the Ye Family afford it again?

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.060
Let's drop this topic.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.060
But Chongqing
is a whole different story.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.700
The frontlines keep falling back.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.220
Supplies in the rear are running low.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.610
If the Ye Family donates a few machines,

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.060
it's like rain after a drought
for the rear.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.700
People will be eager to owe you a favor.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.100
Liang.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:22.820
The Nationalist-controlled Areas
are where you can spread your wings.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.340
Gu, you just said it yourself,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.340
the battlefront is losing ground.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.820
So if I go there,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.100
what kind of hero could I still be?

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.060
Liang, you're playing dumb.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.220
The United States.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.850
The US is preparing to enter the war.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.250
1941, March,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.820
Congress passed the Lend-Lease Law

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.580
and allocated $7 billion
for implementation.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:07.250
This law was, in fact, designed to...

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.700
Liang, you've already heard the news.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.860
The entire United States

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.460
is now under emergency status.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.180
You've lived abroad
and seen the world,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.140
so you understand
the strength of the US.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.530
Take energy alone as an example,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.010
eighty percent of Japan's oil

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.530
comes from US imports.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.380
If the US enters the war,

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.700
the whole situation will change.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.900
By then, even the Wang Government

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.220
won't be able to hold its local power.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.420
What can a small Pacification Committee

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.180
possibly do then?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.660
I've already changed the dressing.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.730
You said the review Sasaki initiated

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.290
is aimed at our Tonoji Family.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.900
Yes, this is already the second time.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.860
Major General Sasaki
isn't targeting Joseph Lee.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.660
He's going after
the entire Tonoji family.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.660
Miss Megumi,
we can't let him keep going.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.050
You've been flaunting the title
of the Duke's sworn son,

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.490
and running scams all over Shanghai.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.660
I haven't settled the score with you,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.700
so where did you get the nerve

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.700
to come ask me to save some fraud?

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.660
Why would he use

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.900
the name of the Duke's sworn son?

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.660
Joseph will explain it to you,

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.730
but he's definitely not a fraud.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.730
He's been doing everything he can

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.220
to protect
the Tonoji family's interests.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.490
Without him,

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.860
in the New Government
and even the East Asia Development Board,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.860
the Tonoji family

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.860
would have lost its place long ago.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.730
Absurd.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.490
The Tonoji family is close to
the Emperor of Japan.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.490
Our position

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.420
doesn't need some outsider to defend.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.900
The Grand Duke is gravely ill

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.250
and you stay out of political affairs.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.250
You likely haven't kept up
with the situation.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.660
The Tōjō faction is eager to

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.050
declare war on Britain and the US.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.980
The Japanese military leadership
is targeting

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.010
those linked to British
or American forces.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.900
The Tonoji family is the primary target.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.180
If it weren't for Joseph,

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.980
holding off the pressure on the family,

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.490
the Grand Duke's sickbed by now

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.220
would probably have been moved into

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.220
the interrogation room.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.490
Mrs. Lee,

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.220
are you trying to stir up discord

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.420
within the Imperial Army of Japan?

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.220
You'll know

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.700
when you read the interrogation records.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.530
I see.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.220
You came here to ease my worries.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.770
Liang, I'm not just here
to ease your worries.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.050
I'm also thinking about this matter.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.460
The Tonojis have already arrived.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.490
Which means the supporter
behind Joseph Lee

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.380
has shown up too.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.140
Even if you become the Chairman,

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.530
do you think you can personally

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.530
break Joseph Lee's leg?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.900
No, that's impossible.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.220
Only by returning to Chongqing

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.860
can you use the name of resist japan

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.900
to openly take revenge on Joseph Lee.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.980
Now that's hitting the point.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.980
It was your BIS that killed Sasaki Taro.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.380
Liang, not "your".

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.220
It was done by our people.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.380
You get our man out safely.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:37.900
And I'll call
the Confidential Office of BIS

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.730
to put in a word for you.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.250
That explains it.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.860
No wonder...

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.290
No wonder when I reported to Chongqing,

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.460
I never got a reply.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.250
Turns out this was the problem.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.250
Liang,

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:46.900
the Daruma Doll at home
can't keep wobbling.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.730
We're out of time.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:21.980
Charlie.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.220
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.380
You know what?

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.730
When I first saw you,

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.460
I found you very intriguing.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:37.980
I didn't expect someone so young

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.460
to have such deep roots
in Chongqing authority.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.010
The Ministry of Economy,
the Finance Committee, the BIS...

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.420
You always get first-hand information.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.250
So, I want to ask,

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.420
who exactly is backing you?

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.980
Does it really matter?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.860
It does.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.420
We're all in this together.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.220
Doesn't matter who earns more or less.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.140
What matters is who I work with.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:18.220
No.154 Nanyang Road, Gu Residence.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.460
I'll say it again.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.140
The wise adapt to the times.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.730
Young Master Gu, to a great partnership.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.010
To a great partnership.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:57.010
To a great partnership.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.700
I understand, Miss Megumi.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.940
But the interrogation record
is classified.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.660
It can't be shared outside.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.460
I have zero interest
in your affairs in China.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.460
Nor do I care

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.180
what you're planning for Joseph Lee.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:23.460
All I want to know

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.770
is your move against the Tonoji family.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.620
If the Lieutenant General wants answers,

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.330
why not just ask me directly?

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.010
Why ask an outsider like Joseph Lee?

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.380
What's that supposed to mean?

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.460
Miss Megumi, you've got it wrong.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.980
The reason we asked about Joseph Lee

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.860
is because we also received a letter

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.250
reporting the Tonoji family.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.250
The claims in it were not entirely true.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.220
That's why we didn't alarm you.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.220
Since there was such a letter,

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.050
why didn't you come verify with us?

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.380
General Yasui,
you're the Duke's old friend.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.980
Once the Grand Duke wakes up,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:09.900
[Interrogation Record]
and hears what you did today,

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.530
he's going to be disappointed.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.940
A report said you're trying

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.700
to monopolize the cipher design work
of the New Government.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.980
Was it instructed by the Tonoji family?

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.770
Your father was the math tutor

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.220
of the Grand Duke Tonoji in Britain.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.700
He was often seen
at the Tonoji Residence.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.290
In the Grand Duke's residence,

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.290
which British nationals have you met?

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.220
Mr. Lee,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.460
every word you say here

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.460
will be recorded.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.420
If proven false, it's an offense
against the Japanese army.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.460
Under Japan's wartime laws,
that's punishable by death.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.770
Don't worry.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.010
I stand by every word I say.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:56.420
I'm even willing to stake my own life

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.900
to guarantee to the Japanese army

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.010
that the Tonoji family's loyalty
is unwavering.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.700
You can doubt me,

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.180
but you should never doubt
the Grand Duke.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.660
General Yasui is in the neutral camp,

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.770
so Joseph could still hold his ground.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.460
But Miss Megumi,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.620
today he's being questioned by Sasaki.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.220
If he says one wrong thing,

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.220
Sasaki will accuse the Tonoji family

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.290
of colluding with the enemy.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:31.050
By then, it'll be too late for anything.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.980
Where did they take Joseph Lee?

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.530
Yuyin Pavilion.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.700
You said I ordered you to take him out?

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.010
Stop pretending.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:50.290
There was a line of bodies
at your feet just now.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.220
All were killed for angering Sasaki.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.460
Stop covering for the Organization.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.250
And stop dragging innocent people in.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.770
The next one lying at your feet

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.460
might just be Mrs. Lee.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.700
Enough!

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.460
Luo Han.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.980
Quit making things up.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.250
Your name is Luo Han.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.220
You quit the math program
at the University of Shanghai,

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.770
then followed your senior Mao Renfeng

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.380
and went to Whampoa Military Academy.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.110
After graduation, you joined

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.220
the Telecommunications Section of BIS.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.250
In 1940,

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.050
you were reassigned
from Chongqing to Shanghai

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.860
on a covert mission.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:59.770
Am I right?

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.660
Your senior really counts on you.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.620
He just called from Chongqing

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.980
and offered me a pretty good deal.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.010
But I turned it down.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.770
Soon after, I made him an offer instead.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.010
I told him,

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.700
this Luo Han is just a pawn.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:30.220
But his partner is something else.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:35.620
They've been deep undercover
in the New Government.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.290
They know our intel inside out,

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.140
even capable of directly calling

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.860
the Confidential Office
of BIS in Chongqing.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.860
That rank must be pretty high.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.980
I want this person's name.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:55.770
If you're willing to tell me,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.010
I can let Luo Han live.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.250
Guess what they said.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.980
He said,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.770
eve if

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.700
I execute you a thousand times,

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.460
he still wouldn't spill

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.250
a single word of info about that person.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:24.220
Mr. Luo, isn't that ironic?

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.980
Here you are, risking your life,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.220
fighting for your party and country,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.730
shielding your comrades,

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.700
yet your own country

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.250
tossed you aside

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.140
like a rag

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.250
to protect that person.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.220
So in your country,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.290
even lives don't weigh the same.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.460
Now I'm even more curious,

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:07.220
Mao Renfeng…

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.860
Who is this person?

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.860
He's worth abandoning
such a trusted junior.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.050
Mao Renfeng

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.530
doesn't want to make a deal with me.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.220
You should be willing to deal with me.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.460
Tell me his name.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.460
And I'll spare your life.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.980
Hey, my plate!

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.620
Alright.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.290
This way, boss.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.290
Breaking Sword Thrust Operation

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.490
away from Cao Yuanzhong is hard.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.620
So if today's mission fails,

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.770
can you take the heat for it?

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:49.700
Gun.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.010
Yes.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.290
You're a hero.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.420
You once dreamed of going out in glory.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.660
It was fate
that never gave you that chance.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:18.460
But I'm giving you a chance to live.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.220
Are you really going to risk it all

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:32.940
for a party and a country

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.530
that don't value your life?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.180
Is it really worth it?

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.860
My partner is

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:19.340
Joseph Lee.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:31.420
Major General,
this man has lost his mind.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:42.900
Mr. Lee, he framed you.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.380
Mr. Lee.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.820
Care to join in

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.420
for a quick round

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.530
just to blow off steam?

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.740
I'd like to as well, Major General.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.900
But I'm blind, I can't see anything.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.570
If I end up killing him,

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.570
wouldn't that cut off your lead

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.900
right here and now?

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.420
That would ruin everything.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.780
You don't need to worry about that.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.420
This guy's had incredible luck.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.610
He's taken out many of our people,

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.130
yet the last bullet

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.900
kept for himself got jammed.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:50.170
You might not even hit him.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:55.740
But I just want to see this time,

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.530
if he can still face death
so fearlessly.

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:24.530
I'll talk, I'll talk... It's Gu...

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.900
Major General, what's wrong?

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.650
Did I kill him?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.530
Mr. Lee, your shooting skills

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.610
are much better than you said.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.420
You almost took his life.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.530
You nearly killed him.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.900
He almost spilled everything.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.570
Major General, he's passed out.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.610
Let's stop the questioning.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.420
Then let's question Mr. Lee instead.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:21.090
Who was he trying to protect?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.420
Major General Sasaki.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.610
Joseph! Joseph!

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.780
Biyun! Biyun!

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.340
Thank goodness, you're alright.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.570
Take Mr. Lee back.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.050
Yes.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.570
Megumi.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.490
Right now, he...

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.260
He's suspected of resisting Japan

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.010
and of murdering a Japanese officer.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.780
We can't let him go.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.820
Megumi.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.570
Don't worry about me.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.420
I can't let my matters
drag down the Tonoji family.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.570
You're only a Major General.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.570
People from the Tonoji family

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:20.050
are not at your disposal to interrogate.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:25.050
So now you're covering for him

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.610
and standing
against the Japanese military?

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.490
Miss Lin.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.490
Can you truly speak
for the Tonoji family?

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.460
I can speak for the Tonoji family.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:56.050
But can you speak
for the Japanese military?

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.460
You're nothing but a dog,

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.010
wagging its tail for Tōjō.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.860
Don't think too highly of yourself.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.460
Take them away.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.530
No way.

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:26.820
Major General.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.650
Major General.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.130
Major General.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.820
Major General.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.980
Taro's funeral is already prepared.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.980
Would you like to take a look?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.610
Miss Megumi, you should leave.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.610
But remember what you just said.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.900
The Tonoji family will definitely pay

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.420
for what happened today.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.530
Go.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.460
Once the Spirit Transfer Ritual
is set up,

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.610
take them there
and question them one by one.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.300
Yes.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.340
Why did you pretend
to be the Duke's sworn son?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.900
Miss Megumi.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:54.570
Once we're back

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:55.860
at the hospital,

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.530
we'll apologize to
the Grand Duke in person.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.340
You'd better.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.050
If you can't give me a good reason,

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.090
I'll be right there at the Duke's side

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.300
and handle this for the Tonoji family

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.090
to clean up our own.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.820
How's the person doing?

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.300
Still alive.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.300
Locked up in the Military Police HQ.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.300
Get him out no matter the cost.

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.460
At any cost?

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.460
No problem.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.170
But Young Master,

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.090
if I pull this off for you,

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.050
my standing with the Japanese...

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:04.090
Get the him out.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.460
Either today or tomorrow,

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.860
I'll arrange for you and Luo Han
to evacuate.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:14.900
