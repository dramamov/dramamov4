Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.264
Here it is!

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:16.717
- Give it to me.
- There it is.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:21.354
Why is there no signal?

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:22.768
We’re out of time.

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:24.911
If they can’t take pictures of the exams,

00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:27.246
I’ll do it myself and find a way.

00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:29.248
Looks like something was forgotten.

00:00:29.248 --> 00:00:31.668
Out of all things,
you forget the breaker?

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:33.628
You have to stall another 20 minutes.

00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:36.631
I’ll find the questionnaires
and that’s what we’ll pull out.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.090
What now, Pat?

00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:39.384
I’m done.

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.152
Just give me the go signal.

00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:42.261
One sec, Kuya Jerry.

00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:43.279
Bank’s not back yet.

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:44.764
We have to wait.

00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:46.432
Turn it on!

00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:51.871
Power’s back on.

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:53.168
But they aren't out yet.

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:55.900
It's my first day as a trainee.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.276
So I felt pressured.

00:00:57.276 --> 00:00:58.861
I got anxious.

00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:01.364
What happened to you?

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.657
We got blocked by the guard.

00:01:02.657 --> 00:01:04.617
The phone was fucking
on me the whole time!

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:07.995
it was in my pocket but I
thought, I thought he saw it!

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:08.663
Yes!

00:01:08.663 --> 00:01:10.039
Don't bother me, let's go!

00:01:16.254 --> 00:01:17.271
Okay, got it.

00:01:17.296 --> 00:01:18.340
Okay.

00:01:18.923 --> 00:01:20.299
Bro, I still don't get it.

00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:22.343
The guard felt the phone in my pocket

00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:23.761
but he still let me go.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.137
How did that happen?

00:01:26.097 --> 00:01:26.572
Bank,

00:01:26.597 --> 00:01:28.808
did you do something
that wasn't part of our plan?

00:01:30.143 --> 00:01:31.160
Nothing.

00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:32.870
Bank,

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:34.605
I saw you and the guard exchange looks.

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:39.379
Is that true?

00:01:40.324 --> 00:01:42.035
Do you know the guard, Bank?

00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:43.071
Yes already!

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:45.408
I paid the guard so he would let me in

00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:48.369
and I paid him big so
he would let us out too.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.454
That was plan B.

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:51.456
Guys, there's something
wrong with the answers.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:55.501
Don't look at me like that.

00:01:55.877 --> 00:01:58.113
Because if I didn’t do that,
we would’ve been caught.

00:01:58.671 --> 00:01:59.672
Lin, listen.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840
Guys.

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:03.234
Guys!

00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:05.349
There is something wrong with the answers.

00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:07.096
Okay, look.

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:09.682
We are missing one, two, three,

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:12.143
six more items.

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.315
Right, this should be thirty items.

00:02:21.277 --> 00:02:21.652
Bank.

00:02:21.652 --> 00:02:23.404
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:02:25.198 --> 00:02:26.299
I remembered it.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.925
B.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.659
Okay, B.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:29.160
D.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.677
D.

00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:30.870
C.

00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:32.663
A.

00:02:32.914 --> 00:02:33.956
A.

00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:36.125
B.

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:37.084
C.

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:42.005
Bank?

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:44.926
That's seven letters!

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.595
We’re missing six!

00:02:49.722 --> 00:02:51.724
Then just remove one if it’s extra!

00:02:52.016 --> 00:02:53.518
What do you mean remove one?!

00:02:54.894 --> 00:02:56.437
Bank, you think you're smart, huh?

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:02.463
Okay then.

00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:04.237
You memorized the whole thing, right?

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:07.031
Enumerate everything again!

00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:09.867
We’ll just double-check!

00:03:10.493 --> 00:03:12.036
Don’t you trust me?

00:03:13.788 --> 00:03:16.332
This isn’t about trust!

00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:20.545
You’ve done things
we didn’t know about!

00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:22.237
Didn’t you think?

00:03:22.262 --> 00:03:25.849
How would we know if you’re still
hiding something from us, Bank?!

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.237
How?!

00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:31.722
So come on, please!

00:03:31.973 --> 00:03:33.057
Come on!

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.698
Let’s just double-check the
answers you remembered!

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.691
You’re the only one who
saw the questionnaire, Bank.

00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:43.635
Only you!

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:52.033
D.

00:03:53.452 --> 00:03:54.452
B.

00:03:55.246 --> 00:03:56.246
B.

00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:57.831
C.

00:03:58.833 --> 00:03:59.833
A.

00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:01.501
A.

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:03.169
B.

00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:04.671
C.

00:04:10.636 --> 00:04:11.636
Oh, Bank!

00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:13.222
Did you really memorize it?!

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:14.282
Huh?!

00:04:14.307 --> 00:04:15.474
Did you memorize it?!

00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:18.394
The first answer is already wrong!

00:04:19.103 --> 00:04:20.688
Bro, think harder!

00:04:21.147 --> 00:04:22.732
Concentrate, Bank!

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:24.191
Forget it!

00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:27.361
We’re just fooling ourselves!

00:04:31.073 --> 00:04:33.200
Bank has photographic memory.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.329
If he can’t recite the answers,

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:40.041
maybe he didn’t really answer at all.

00:05:30.758 --> 00:05:32.635
- Bank?
- Okay!

00:05:37.056 --> 00:05:38.057
There's too many!

00:06:20.975 --> 00:06:23.436
I ran out of time to
answer the exam.

00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:26.105
So I just made
up all the answers.

00:06:27.148 --> 00:06:29.233
- Are you fucking serious, Bank?
- Bank?

00:06:31.027 --> 00:06:32.528
No, no, no, no, no.

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:34.279
Holy shit!

00:06:38.038 --> 00:06:40.457
Why did you lie to us, Bank?!

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.288
Why?

00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:43.349
Huh?

00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:45.415
Look.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.934
Okay.

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.836
Let’s call Miss Maya
while it’s still early

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:51.881
tell her we didn’t get the
questionnaire and all will be well.

00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:53.215
- We'll return the money and...
- Return what?!

00:06:53.215 --> 00:06:54.467
Don’t do that!

00:06:55.426 --> 00:06:56.402
Lin!

00:06:56.427 --> 00:06:58.387
All our hard work
will go to waste.

00:06:58.596 --> 00:06:59.739
Think of this.

00:06:59.764 --> 00:07:01.390
We’re in a win-win
situation here.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.867
- We’ll give them the answers.
- What the?!

00:07:02.892 --> 00:07:04.143
We’ll get our money.

00:07:04.143 --> 00:07:05.143
Done!

00:07:06.312 --> 00:07:08.522
You’ll give out random answers?!

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:09.889
Huh?

00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:14.737
We already cheated on the exam!

00:07:15.988 --> 00:07:18.074
Now, we're gonna
scam our clients too?!

00:07:18.074 --> 00:07:18.574
Lin!

00:07:18.574 --> 00:07:19.450
What’s that?

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.618
Listen to me.

00:07:21.952 --> 00:07:23.454
They’re already rich.

00:07:23.454 --> 00:07:25.349
Fifty thousand Pesos is just
a loose change to them.

00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:27.792
Think of how we’ll
get our money back?

00:07:31.378 --> 00:07:32.354
Okay.

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:33.606
Alright, Bank.

00:07:33.631 --> 00:07:39.303
But maybe you didn’t think
about the future of the 800 students

00:07:39.637 --> 00:07:41.305
who are relying on us!

00:07:41.305 --> 00:07:42.306
How?

00:07:43.057 --> 00:07:44.091
Huh?

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:47.269
They’ll fail!

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:49.188
Then let them fail, Lin!

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:51.774
They wanted to cheat, right?

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:54.819
They should accept the fact
that they'll be cheated too.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.827
What happened to you?

00:08:03.786 --> 00:08:04.826
Huh?

00:08:05.287 --> 00:08:06.413
Since when have
you been like this?

00:08:06.413 --> 00:08:07.515
Been what?

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.958
Become a bad person?

00:08:09.834 --> 00:08:12.628
Unlike you, Lin,
you won’t lose anything.

00:08:12.628 --> 00:08:15.047
Whatever the result is,
you can still study abroad,

00:08:15.047 --> 00:08:15.981
both of you!

00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:17.758
You can also study abroad!

00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:21.261
Right?

00:08:22.972 --> 00:08:24.073
Bank!

00:08:24.098 --> 00:08:26.100
That has nothing
to do with this!

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.268
What do you mean nothing, Lin?!

00:08:28.644 --> 00:08:29.687
Think about it!

00:08:30.813 --> 00:08:34.150
If you have no money, if
you can’t study anymore,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.860
if you have no future,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.447
if all of this, you’re just holding
onto a knife’s edge, think about it.

00:08:39.947 --> 00:08:40.990
Let’s think about
this, let’s think—

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.575
Will you think of other people?

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.618
Or will I just think of myself?

00:08:44.618 --> 00:08:45.786
Holy shit, wait.

00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:48.789
Let's not all act clean here.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.125
We all need money.

00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:53.043
Maybe I need it more
than you guys.

00:08:53.836 --> 00:08:55.671
But my plan already failed.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.925
My plan failed and I don't want everything
I built for three months to go to waste.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.161
Everything I worked hard
for us to be here.

00:09:03.262 --> 00:09:04.889
I don’t want it to be ruined.

00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:08.641
Wait.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.560
You said,

00:09:11.187 --> 00:09:13.522
you worked hard
to bring us together?

00:09:17.443 --> 00:09:20.446
You know after graduation,
Grace and I are going to Boston?

00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:22.656
You’re taking so long.

00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:23.866
Sorry, boss.

00:09:23.866 --> 00:09:25.284
We almost got into an accident.

00:09:32.208 --> 00:09:33.267
I didn’t mean it.

00:09:33.292 --> 00:09:35.211
Yes, I paid them to
mess up your shop.

00:09:35.211 --> 00:09:37.188
But I didn’t tell them
to hurt your mom.

00:09:37.213 --> 00:09:38.672
I just want you to help us.

00:09:38.672 --> 00:09:39.840
Well, it already
happened, right?

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.841
But she’s fine!

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:43.427
You already got your 500k.

00:09:44.136 --> 00:09:45.905
If you want, I'll give
you half of my share.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:46.947
Idiot!

00:09:46.972 --> 00:09:48.824
Not everything can
be solved with money!

00:09:48.849 --> 00:09:50.476
- Bank.
- Bank, we’re desperate.

00:09:50.476 --> 00:09:52.519
If all this didn’t happen,
you wouldn’t have said yes.

00:09:53.229 --> 00:09:55.314
Just remember,
Pat. I’m telling you.

00:09:55.689 --> 00:09:57.233
I'll give all this back to you.

00:09:58.484 --> 00:10:01.362
Were you the one who
leaked the STIC?

00:10:01.612 --> 00:10:02.655
Huh?

00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:33.309
Come on, Tristan.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.104
It’s over.

00:10:35.104 --> 00:10:36.563
There’s nothing
we can do anymore.

00:10:44.363 --> 00:10:45.363
Sorry, Mom.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.701
I just wanted you
to proceed with the surgery.

00:10:51.787 --> 00:10:52.787
Tristan.

00:10:58.369 --> 00:11:01.038
Maybe not this way.

00:11:02.187 --> 00:11:05.065
All your hard work was wasted.

00:11:06.343 --> 00:11:07.344
Such a waste.

00:11:16.895 --> 00:11:17.895
No, Mom.

00:11:19.356 --> 00:11:20.524
I’ll make it up.

00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:26.655
I’ll still give you a good life.

00:11:26.989 --> 00:11:28.240
No matter what happens.

00:11:39.209 --> 00:11:40.209
Let's go.

00:11:50.137 --> 00:11:54.016
Your father tells me that you
almost got a perfect score at the STIC.

00:11:54.391 --> 00:11:57.603
So do you have any advice,
to inspire other students?

00:11:57.968 --> 00:11:59.427
I guess you just
gotta put in the work

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.316
and do whatever it
takes to make it to the top.

00:12:03.776 --> 00:12:05.694
You must be very proud of Pat.

00:12:05.694 --> 00:12:06.945
Oh, yeah.

00:12:06.945 --> 00:12:08.280
Very, very proud.

00:12:14.536 --> 00:12:16.455
The STIC results are in.

00:12:16.455 --> 00:12:17.039
Yup.

00:12:17.064 --> 00:12:18.732
She’s in the top percentile.

00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:21.126
Ah, Grace.

00:12:21.877 --> 00:12:23.504
We’re very proud of you.

00:12:23.504 --> 00:12:24.505
All of us. Hmm.

00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:26.357
Good job, Grace.

00:12:26.757 --> 00:12:27.257
Okay?

00:12:27.257 --> 00:12:28.400
Keep it up.

00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:29.510
Thanks, Dad.

00:12:30.512 --> 00:12:31.722
It was nothing.

00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:33.179
Really.

00:12:36.016 --> 00:12:37.029
This can’t be.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.687
They all got what
they want except me.

00:12:44.311 --> 00:12:46.354
It was declared
by the universities

00:12:46.527 --> 00:12:51.573
that all STIC results coming from
this round are automatically invalid.

00:12:51.782 --> 00:12:55.369
The Education Commission
continues to investigate

00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:58.163
the cheating scandal
and those involved in it.

00:13:17.057 --> 00:13:17.808
Huh, Bank?!

00:13:17.808 --> 00:13:19.977
- Were you the one who snitched?
- Yes! Yes!

00:13:19.977 --> 00:13:20.978
Yes, Pat!

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.815
I’m the one responsible
for all of that.

00:13:25.232 --> 00:13:27.943
But what's the difference between
what I did and what you did to me?

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.002
Huh?

00:13:29.027 --> 00:13:30.821
- You bastard, Bank! Huh!
- Stop! Enough!

00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:31.864
- Huh?!
- Let go of me!

00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:34.116
- Enough!
- What?!

00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:36.910
Do you understand now, Pat?

00:13:37.619 --> 00:13:41.623
Now you know the feeling of
having no other option but to cheat.

00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:43.166
Huh?

00:13:45.127 --> 00:13:46.170
You know what, Pat?

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.880
You’re already free from your father.

00:13:49.173 --> 00:13:50.223
And me,

00:13:51.216 --> 00:13:54.511
money is the replacement for
everything that was taken from me.

00:13:56.597 --> 00:13:58.223
You needed me at
the STIC back then.

00:13:58.682 --> 00:14:00.809
And I need you here
at the NCET, Pat.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.148
That’s why you have no
other choice but to go with me

00:14:06.148 --> 00:14:09.026
until the end just like how
I went with you back then, right?

00:14:14.156 --> 00:14:15.156
What?

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.910
Who else wants to continue this?

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.958
Let’s vote!

00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:20.934
Bank!

00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:22.302
Bank!

00:14:22.498 --> 00:14:23.583
No!

00:14:25.292 --> 00:14:26.294
No!

00:14:28.086 --> 00:14:29.130
Grace!

00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:30.192
What?

00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:37.013
So, Pat?

00:14:41.183 --> 00:14:42.809
Whatever Pat says.

00:14:49.066 --> 00:14:50.108
You’re embarrassing!

00:14:50.108 --> 00:14:51.860
You were even
arrogant in the interview!

00:14:52.194 --> 00:14:53.237
My god!

00:14:54.071 --> 00:14:57.449
I gave you everything you
needed, all your luxuries

00:14:57.449 --> 00:15:00.953
I indulged you and this
is what I get in return?

00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:07.709
Dad, I'm trying my best.

00:15:09.461 --> 00:15:12.297
But honestly, I don’t
want to go to BU.

00:15:14.508 --> 00:15:16.718
I’m already struggling
with your expectations.

00:15:18.387 --> 00:15:19.387
I could...

00:15:20.514 --> 00:15:22.015
I could never be like you.

00:15:24.226 --> 00:15:25.226
No.

00:15:26.103 --> 00:15:27.938
But you are a Tioseco.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.858
And you will graduate
from Boston University.

00:15:32.183 --> 00:15:35.559
You will retake the
STIC and get,

00:15:35.592 --> 00:15:40.033
by studying, the high
marks that you got before.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.368
Or else...

00:15:41.368 --> 00:15:42.786
Or else you’ll do what, Dad?

00:15:43.662 --> 00:15:46.582
No matter what I do, I
am never enough for you.

00:15:48.375 --> 00:15:51.587
You silly, stupid boy.

00:15:51.587 --> 00:15:53.589
You are nothing without me.

00:15:53.714 --> 00:15:56.383
Everything you
have came from me,

00:15:56.383 --> 00:15:58.427
don’t you ever forget that.

00:15:59.386 --> 00:16:01.013
Well, I’m done
living off with you.

00:16:02.014 --> 00:16:03.140
I can do it on my own.

00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:05.475
Cut me off, throw me off.

00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:09.293
I don’t care anymore.

00:16:10.647 --> 00:16:11.898
Well, neither do I.

00:16:12.316 --> 00:16:14.359
See if you can
survive without me.

00:16:14.359 --> 00:16:15.669
Go ahead.

00:16:15.694 --> 00:16:17.070
Go ahead and fail!

00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:25.412
Grace, print the answers.

00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:26.673
Pat!

00:16:29.708 --> 00:16:31.752
Lin, I don’t want to
go back to my dad.

00:16:33.503 --> 00:16:35.047
So we’re going to continue this.

00:16:35.881 --> 00:16:36.815
Hon.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.342
Print it now, quick!

00:16:38.342 --> 00:16:39.109
Sis,

00:16:39.134 --> 00:16:40.134
Sis!

00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:52.189
I'm sorry, Lin.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.730
Yup.

00:16:55.067 --> 00:16:57.444
I have to stand by Pat.

00:17:00.238 --> 00:17:01.323
- Okay, Grace.
- Okay.

00:17:03.533 --> 00:17:05.369
If that's your final decision,

00:17:05.911 --> 00:17:08.080
I have nothing to do with this.

00:17:10.165 --> 00:17:11.166
I get it.

00:17:12.125 --> 00:17:13.126
I get it.

00:17:14.544 --> 00:17:15.045
Okay, Grace.

00:17:15.045 --> 00:17:16.672
Just remove one
letter then print it.

00:17:16.697 --> 00:17:17.697
Go ahead.

00:17:21.051 --> 00:17:22.051
Lin.

00:17:25.472 --> 00:17:26.556
Just play along.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.142
You won’t lose anything.

00:17:30.185 --> 00:17:31.645
Just turn a
blind eye to this, Lin.

00:17:54.501 --> 00:17:55.627
Let's go, Grace.

00:17:56.795 --> 00:17:57.921
Okay, I'll go.

00:17:57.921 --> 00:17:59.881
- I'll print now.
- Come on, let's print it.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.337
Lin!

00:18:22.362 --> 00:18:23.488
Where have you been?

00:18:23.488 --> 00:18:24.823
Why are you only coming home now?

00:18:28.368 --> 00:18:30.036
I'm so sorry, Dad.

00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:37.919
I'm so sorry.

00:18:43.633 --> 00:18:45.302
I'll tell you everything.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.764
But I hope...

00:18:49.222 --> 00:18:51.099
I hope to ask
something from you.

00:18:52.851 --> 00:18:53.851
What is it?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.318
I hope you’ll come with me to
the Educational Commission.

00:19:02.027 --> 00:19:04.321
They need to know
something important.

00:19:11.745 --> 00:19:12.745
Okay.

00:19:15.499 --> 00:19:16.750
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:19:18.168 --> 00:19:19.795
I hope you won’t be mad.

00:19:24.007 --> 00:19:24.716
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:26.218
It's okay.

00:19:26.218 --> 00:19:27.844
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

00:19:33.475 --> 00:19:35.811
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to.

00:19:36.102 --> 00:19:37.102
It's okay.

00:19:37.646 --> 00:19:38.646
Lin.

00:19:39.731 --> 00:19:40.731
It's okay.

00:19:44.653 --> 00:19:45.987
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:09.886
Chaos ensued at several
testing sites this morning

00:20:09.886 --> 00:20:11.304
when a sudden halt

00:20:11.304 --> 00:20:13.348
to the National College Entrance
Test was ordered,

00:20:13.348 --> 00:20:16.601
due to the revelation of a
leakage in the test questions.

00:20:47.632 --> 00:20:49.467
According to the
Education Commission,

00:20:49.467 --> 00:20:51.970
a 17-year-old student

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.223
let’s hide under the name
Angel, voluntarily reported

00:20:55.223 --> 00:20:57.851
that she and
three of her friends

00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:00.520
attempted to steal the
NCET questionnaire

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.025
and sell it to some
clients for 50,000 pesos.

00:21:05.025 --> 00:21:06.025
What?

00:21:06.943 --> 00:21:08.236
This can't be happening.

00:21:08.236 --> 00:21:09.821
What do we do, Grace?

00:21:11.364 --> 00:21:13.033
We should've
just listened to Lin.

00:21:13.033 --> 00:21:15.785
We should've just stopped
and returned the money.

00:21:22.042 --> 00:21:22.767
Cops.

00:21:22.792 --> 00:21:23.792
Wait.

00:21:24.085 --> 00:21:25.085
We don't know yet.

00:21:28.048 --> 00:21:29.257
We'll just deny everything.

00:21:29.257 --> 00:21:30.258
I'll do the talking, okay?

00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:33.862
Dad?

00:21:33.887 --> 00:21:34.971
How did you find me?

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.781
That's really not important.

00:21:36.806 --> 00:21:38.975
I need to have a
word with my son.

00:21:39.394 --> 00:21:41.519
You’d better just
go home, Grace.

00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:42.854
The driver will take you.

00:21:43.063 --> 00:21:43.830
No.

00:21:43.855 --> 00:21:44.940
Grace stays here.

00:21:45.607 --> 00:21:47.192
Tell me what you want
to say in front of her.

00:21:47.217 --> 00:21:48.217
Alright.

00:21:48.944 --> 00:21:50.487
I've made all the arrangements.

00:21:50.487 --> 00:21:52.030
You're going to the US.

00:21:52.238 --> 00:21:53.615
You'll study there.

00:21:54.115 --> 00:21:55.533
And we have to leave now.

00:21:55.533 --> 00:21:57.661
Your flight's in four hours.

00:21:57.661 --> 00:21:59.079
And as for this scandal,

00:21:59.579 --> 00:22:00.413
I'll take care of it

00:22:00.413 --> 00:22:04.334
like I always do whenever
you mess around.

00:22:05.001 --> 00:22:05.418
What?

00:22:05.418 --> 00:22:09.506
And we have no time to
dwell on your stupid mistakes.

00:22:09.631 --> 00:22:10.273
No.

00:22:10.298 --> 00:22:11.299
What about Grace?

00:22:11.424 --> 00:22:13.885
It’s better if you break up.

00:22:20.558 --> 00:22:21.618
What?

00:22:21.643 --> 00:22:23.603
Grace and I can’t break up, Dad.

00:22:24.479 --> 00:22:25.479
And what?

00:22:26.106 --> 00:22:27.440
You're going to
stay here with her

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.944
and when you’re jailed, you
think you’ll be together in one cell?

00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:32.361
Jesus.

00:22:33.363 --> 00:22:34.363
Dad, please.

00:22:34.614 --> 00:22:35.407
I'm begging you.

00:22:35.407 --> 00:22:36.783
Please help Grace too.

00:22:37.158 --> 00:22:38.410
We'll be together.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.285
I'll do anything.

00:22:39.285 --> 00:22:40.912
I won’t rebel anymore.

00:22:40.912 --> 00:22:41.871
Please, Dad.

00:22:42.038 --> 00:22:43.289
A federal lawyer.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.516
A good one.

00:22:44.541 --> 00:22:46.876
But you can’t be
together anymore.

00:22:46.876 --> 00:22:49.295
Aside from her
father not allowing it,

00:22:49.295 --> 00:22:52.215
all you do is bring
trouble and problems.

00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:56.845
You never learned
from what you did.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:57.970
You wanna help her?

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.306
Just obey.

00:23:02.642 --> 00:23:03.977
I'll wait for you in the car.

00:23:10.191 --> 00:23:11.191
Hon.

00:23:12.277 --> 00:23:13.277
I'm sorry.

00:23:14.988 --> 00:23:16.573
I don't wanna leave you.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.708
I'm gonna miss you.

00:23:40.805 --> 00:23:42.015
It's okay, Hon.

00:23:44.392 --> 00:23:46.269
You know, maybe
your dad is right.

00:23:49.566 --> 00:23:53.026
We'll just call and
I'll video chat you.

00:23:53.735 --> 00:23:57.197
And maybe if my dad lets
me, I'll just visit you there.

00:24:06.164 --> 00:24:07.832
I love you so much.

00:24:10.478 --> 00:24:11.478
I love you.

00:24:18.134 --> 00:24:19.302
Good bye.

00:24:30.688 --> 00:24:31.688
That's him.

00:24:32.441 --> 00:24:33.631
- That's him, alright.
- There.

00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:36.891
Tristan Bangkat.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.573
We have a warrant
of arrest for you.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.952
Uh, what is this?

00:24:43.952 --> 00:24:44.552
Why?

00:24:44.577 --> 00:24:45.870
Your son has a case.

00:24:46.822 --> 00:24:47.822
Case?

00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:50.499
Huh?

00:24:51.793 --> 00:24:54.729
Tristan, you have the
right to remain silent.

00:24:54.754 --> 00:24:58.508
Anything you say can and will
be used for or against you in court.

00:24:58.758 --> 00:25:00.885
You also have the right
to get your own lawyer.

00:25:00.885 --> 00:25:02.403
- And if you can’t afford one,
- Wait a moment.

00:25:02.428 --> 00:25:04.305
- the government will provide one.
- Please wait.

00:25:04.639 --> 00:25:06.015
- Do you understand your rights?
- Please wait.

00:25:06.766 --> 00:25:07.976
Please wait.

00:25:09.018 --> 00:25:10.145
Hold on a second.

00:25:11.396 --> 00:25:13.189
- What did you do?
- Sorry, Mom.

00:25:13.648 --> 00:25:14.983
Sorry, Mom.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.317
Don't worry, Tristan.

00:25:16.442 --> 00:25:19.529
Tristan, I’ll get a good lawyer.

00:25:19.529 --> 00:25:20.864
I won’t abandon you.

00:25:20.864 --> 00:25:21.823
Remember that.

00:25:21.823 --> 00:25:23.199
I’m right here.

00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:24.868
Come on now, come with us.

00:25:24.868 --> 00:25:27.704
- Please wait.
- Mom, don’t leave me.

00:25:27.996 --> 00:25:29.305
Come now, come with us.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.956
Come now, come on!

00:25:29.956 --> 00:25:31.499
- Mom!
- Wait! Wait!

00:25:31.499 --> 00:25:32.809
Mom!

00:25:32.834 --> 00:25:34.586
Mom, no! Come with me!

00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:36.105
Mom!

00:25:36.588 --> 00:25:37.547
- Mom!
- Come now!

00:25:37.547 --> 00:25:39.966
All test scores will be voided

00:25:39.966 --> 00:25:43.970
and a new round of the NCET
will be conducted next month.

00:25:45.597 --> 00:25:47.056
Two more have been arrested

00:25:47.056 --> 00:25:49.851
for cheating in the NCET exams.

00:25:50.226 --> 00:25:53.855
A former professor,
identified as Maya Salinas

00:25:53.855 --> 00:25:57.108
was the clients' contact in
the cheating scandal.

00:25:57.317 --> 00:26:02.155
Her license will be revoked and
her tutorial center will be shut down.

00:26:04.908 --> 00:26:06.701
An investigation
was also conducted

00:26:06.701 --> 00:26:09.996
among the employees
working at DL Printing

00:26:09.996 --> 00:26:12.373
because of the
NCET exam scandal.

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:25.553
It was also decided in the
fiscal’s preliminary investigation

00:26:25.553 --> 00:26:28.056
that alias "Angel" and alias "Baby"

00:26:28.056 --> 00:26:32.769
will both be acquitted due
to lack of intent in their cases

00:26:32.977 --> 00:26:36.439
and also because of their
clean criminal records.

00:26:46.241 --> 00:26:47.742
I'm sorry this happened to you.

00:26:55.875 --> 00:26:57.835
I should've apologized too.

00:26:59.128 --> 00:27:00.168
You know,

00:27:00.363 --> 00:27:02.340
I should've just
listened to you.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.217
I shouldn't have
printed those answers

00:27:04.217 --> 00:27:06.302
and I should've just
stopped it right there.

00:27:09.514 --> 00:27:12.574
It's okay.

00:27:19.983 --> 00:27:20.988
You know,

00:27:22.527 --> 00:27:23.903
when the cops came,

00:27:24.821 --> 00:27:26.739
I thought I was
going to be scared.

00:27:30.535 --> 00:27:32.954
But honestly, for some reason,

00:27:32.954 --> 00:27:36.541
I felt like a weight had
been lifted off of my chest.

00:27:38.459 --> 00:27:39.919
I don't have to lie anymore.

00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:42.088
I don't have to pretend anymore.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.590
Thank you, Attorney.

00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:52.389
Grace.

00:28:01.733 --> 00:28:02.942
Didn’t I tell you

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:05.945
to stay away from her?

00:28:19.042 --> 00:28:20.042
Sis.

00:28:37.518 --> 00:28:38.518
Let’s go.

00:28:42.815 --> 00:28:43.815
Attorney.

00:28:55.578 --> 00:28:57.538
I’ll always visit you.

00:29:02.293 --> 00:29:05.004
The alleged mastermind
of the cheating scandal

00:29:05.004 --> 00:29:07.090
hidden under the alias "Charles"

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:11.552
will be detained in a
Youth Detention Center for a year

00:29:11.552 --> 00:29:15.515
due to his previous case
of cheating in the last STIC.

00:30:17.493 --> 00:30:18.496
Dad.

00:30:20.246 --> 00:30:22.665
I brought you modules

00:30:23.583 --> 00:30:26.752
so you'll stay updated with the lessons
even if you’re not in school.

00:30:30.047 --> 00:30:31.047
Thank you, Dad.

00:30:35.678 --> 00:30:37.263
Do you have any problems?

00:30:38.598 --> 00:30:39.682
You look sad.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.642
Nothing, Dad.

00:30:42.977 --> 00:30:45.897
I just feel guilty because
you're still kind to me

00:30:46.522 --> 00:30:48.262
even though I'm
a bad daughter to you.

00:30:49.734 --> 00:30:51.736
I keep on disappointing you.

00:30:56.483 --> 00:30:57.483
Is that so?

00:30:58.951 --> 00:31:01.162
I think, maybe...

00:31:03.372 --> 00:31:04.665
maybe I should be

00:31:05.708 --> 00:31:07.668
more disappointed to myself.

00:31:09.378 --> 00:31:10.463
You know, Lin,

00:31:11.005 --> 00:31:12.965
I knew nothing
about being a father

00:31:13.424 --> 00:31:14.592
before you came.

00:31:16.719 --> 00:31:18.012
So maybe

00:31:19.138 --> 00:31:20.890
I was the one lacking,

00:31:21.516 --> 00:31:23.309
maybe I didn’t even know

00:31:23.893 --> 00:31:26.437
how to truly
raise you properly.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.080
But

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.734
don’t you ever say,

00:31:32.568 --> 00:31:34.820
that you’re a disappointment
to me. Because you’re not.

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:36.489
I even admire you.

00:31:38.032 --> 00:31:39.450
You’re not just smart.

00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:43.663
You make mistakes, yes.

00:31:43.663 --> 00:31:44.288
But,

00:31:45.915 --> 00:31:49.210
you know in your heart
what's right to fix yourself.

00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:52.171
You still choose
to do what’s right.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.298
And because of that,

00:31:56.801 --> 00:31:58.135
you’re a blessing to me.

00:31:58.594 --> 00:31:59.971
I’m proud of you.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:02.430
No, Dad.

00:32:05.017 --> 00:32:07.478
Have you ever had
a student like that?

00:32:09.939 --> 00:32:11.023
Which one,

00:32:11.566 --> 00:32:13.693
the proper, decent, smart one?

00:32:16.279 --> 00:32:17.530
I don’t know, maybe.

00:32:18.531 --> 00:32:20.908
The only thing I can
do as a teacher...

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:24.579
is my best,

00:32:25.371 --> 00:32:30.293
hoping that someday, one of those
kids will learn something from me.

00:32:31.419 --> 00:32:32.587
Even if

00:32:33.588 --> 00:32:35.339
I don't personally see their growth,

00:32:36.215 --> 00:32:37.383
it doesn't matter to me anymore.

00:32:38.593 --> 00:32:41.846
The best student of my
life is right here by my side.

00:32:45.088 --> 00:32:46.088
That’s you.

00:32:47.018 --> 00:32:48.060
Thank you, Dad.

00:32:51.647 --> 00:32:52.732
Love you, Dad.

00:32:52.732 --> 00:32:53.733
I love you, Linlin.

00:32:53.733 --> 00:32:55.151
Don’t be sad anymore, okay?

00:32:56.444 --> 00:32:57.486
Thanks again.

00:32:58.237 --> 00:32:59.237
Don’t mention it.

00:33:22.419 --> 00:33:23.419
Hi.

00:33:24.847 --> 00:33:26.932
I hope that the auditorium

00:33:27.308 --> 00:33:30.770
gets done in time for
your batch's graduation

00:33:31.854 --> 00:33:32.854
You know,

00:33:34.357 --> 00:33:36.067
I genuinely thought

00:33:36.484 --> 00:33:39.779
either you or Tristan would
be valedictorian of your class.

00:33:41.482 --> 00:33:42.567
As it turns out,

00:33:44.867 --> 00:33:47.662
in the history of
Possenti, the top

00:33:47.953 --> 00:33:48.958
students

00:33:49.246 --> 00:33:53.459
were also the ones who did the
most shameful act they could possibly do.

00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:56.337
Maybe in the next tournament,

00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:58.839
Possenti might also
make it to the championship

00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:00.800
if Lin plays.

00:34:08.891 --> 00:34:11.227
That is if you'll give her a chance

00:34:11.227 --> 00:34:13.437
to be a scholar of Possenti.

00:34:14.522 --> 00:34:16.691
Well, that's asking
for too much, Vin.

00:34:18.526 --> 00:34:19.502
I know.

00:34:19.527 --> 00:34:23.197
That’s why I’m thankful you
came so you could witness Lin.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:25.241
that she could be
the student to win

00:34:25.241 --> 00:34:27.076
all of your academic
competitions

00:34:27.076 --> 00:34:29.161
if you give her a chance.

00:34:31.059 --> 00:34:32.101
You're right.

00:34:33.416 --> 00:34:35.084
I mean, she's
highly intelligent.

00:34:37.211 --> 00:34:39.463
I would like to ask
for your forgiveness.

00:34:40.464 --> 00:34:42.341
I'm truly sorry for
everything that happened.

00:34:43.467 --> 00:34:45.678
You could expel me, but...

00:34:46.137 --> 00:34:47.154
you didn't.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:48.179
Right.

00:34:49.807 --> 00:34:52.768
You should also be punished
like what happened to Tristan.

00:34:53.561 --> 00:34:54.562
But,

00:34:55.271 --> 00:34:56.789
you have shown remorse.

00:34:56.814 --> 00:34:58.441
You surrendered
to the authorities.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.901
Which brings me to my point.

00:35:02.319 --> 00:35:05.406
I think, you don’t
need to leave Possenti.

00:35:06.699 --> 00:35:08.117
But I need your help.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.660
What is that?

00:35:12.747 --> 00:35:13.747
This year,

00:35:14.707 --> 00:35:17.251
applications opened

00:35:18.085 --> 00:35:20.296
for Alami-Khatib Scholarship.

00:35:21.172 --> 00:35:22.965
This only happens
every two years

00:35:23.591 --> 00:35:24.592
for applicants.

00:35:25.468 --> 00:35:29.138
In my opinion, this is the
most difficult scholarship

00:35:29.305 --> 00:35:30.389
compared to all.

00:35:31.265 --> 00:35:36.854
You will be competing against
students from all over Southeast Asia.

00:35:39.523 --> 00:35:40.526
And,

00:35:42.526 --> 00:35:45.154
Lin, I think you’re the
only one who can win this

00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:46.655
in the whole school.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.665
I thought I made
the right choice.

00:35:57.458 --> 00:35:59.710
But was my choice
right for everyone?

00:36:00.461 --> 00:36:03.881
Maybe we can ask
Grace's family for donations.

00:36:04.089 --> 00:36:06.133
Don't they own a chain
of printing presses?

00:36:06.759 --> 00:36:07.791
Right.

00:36:07.885 --> 00:36:10.262
Ask her Dad if he
can sponsor us.

00:36:12.098 --> 00:36:13.098
Hi, man.

00:36:14.362 --> 00:36:15.851
If you need help
with your report,

00:36:16.143 --> 00:36:18.896
you can just pay a
guy, to write it for you.

00:36:19.897 --> 00:36:20.924
I know someone.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.792
You want his number?

00:36:22.817 --> 00:36:24.401
I know what you're thinking.

00:36:25.402 --> 00:36:26.153
Lin, you know what?

00:36:26.153 --> 00:36:27.571
This is just how the system is.

00:36:27.571 --> 00:36:29.073
This is how the world works.

00:36:29.156 --> 00:36:32.159
If you win this scholarship,
you get to go to school here.

00:36:32.159 --> 00:36:35.246
And next year, your dreams
of going to school abroad,

00:36:35.246 --> 00:36:36.413
will come true.

00:36:36.705 --> 00:36:38.707
I've made my final
decision just now.

00:36:38.999 --> 00:36:41.085
One of us should be
able to get in there.

00:36:41.377 --> 00:36:42.837
Maybe it takes

00:36:43.129 --> 00:36:47.633
a good cheater to redesign a
system without poverty and corruption.

00:36:47.758 --> 00:36:49.093
The decision is yours, Bank.
