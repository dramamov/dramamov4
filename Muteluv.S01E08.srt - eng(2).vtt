Comrade Phupar,

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.900
you can take my place and be the new Father.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.700
All you need to do is follow the guidelines
in this book and bring Ploy back.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.340
Then everything will be perfect.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.380
Father

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.420
Ploy, will you join me?

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.580
Right here.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.590
Right now.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.260
And forever.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.930
Do you have a dream?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.880
Everyone has different dreams.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.430
Some of you may have big dreams.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.060
Some want to be rich.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.260
Some want to be famous.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.000
But for some people.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.490
But for some people.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.670
They only have small dreams.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.200
They want to be loved.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.010
[PLOY, ARE YOU OKAY?]
[I‘M OKAY. DON’T CONTACT ME AGAIN.]

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.630
Are you going through something?

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.840
Why don’t you join a cult?

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.784
I believe in magic power and sorcery.

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:41.056
But I don’t believe in cults
that brainwash people, Boss.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.296
I know it. I’m just kidding you.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.984
It would be nice if everyone thought like you.

Hurry up before the tickets are sold out.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.928
Come on. Let’s go in.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.264
It will bring you good luck.

00:02:40.288 --> 00:02:41.088
This one?

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.024
If you have a problem,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.232
don’t be so quick to blame yourself.

00:02:58.272 --> 00:03:00.000
Why don’t you look around
and blame others for it first?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.536
Why don’t you look around
and blame others for it first?

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.712
Daddy Phu.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.520
If you want to join the Hi-touch event
with Daddy Phu in the afternoon,

00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:19.256
the tickets are selling out fast.

00:03:19.272 --> 00:03:23.552
If you still don’t have a ticket,
hurry and get your ticket.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.040
The tickets are so expensive.

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:28.500
Is he trying to raise money for a new building?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.464
Hello, everyone.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.552
Do you miss your daddy?

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.616
Mommy Ploy.

00:04:55.656 --> 00:04:58.432
Are you ready to receive power from the moon?

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.880
We are ready.

Hi, Comrade Wutkrai.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.848
Hello, Comrade Yok.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.000
Gosh, you remember me?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.800
Gosh, you remember me?

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.800
Of course, Comrade Yok.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.920
I remember you, too.

00:06:06.888 --> 00:06:10.408
I remember that you are a cop.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.072
Let me go.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.120
Don’t ever come back.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.912
The security is very tight.

00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:08.216
How do I get in?

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.208
So true, bro.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.712
- Fay.
- Officer.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.632
You are a police officer.

00:07:19.664 --> 00:07:21.872
How could you let my friend
get into this trouble?

00:07:21.888 --> 00:07:23.870
But you are her friend.

00:07:23.904 --> 00:07:25.008
You are much closer to her.

00:07:25.032 --> 00:07:25.920
Why didn’t you stop her?

00:07:25.952 --> 00:07:28.144
She didn’t tell me
that she was going to do this.

00:07:28.168 --> 00:07:29.880
She didn’t tell me either.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.264
Yeah, I can tell.

00:07:31.272 --> 00:07:33.288
Otherwise, we wouldn’t be arguing like this.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.320
It’s useless for us to argue about it.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.696
Can you tell me
everything you know about it?

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.888
(Last month,
Ploy was packing her stuff from our room.)

00:08:04.688 --> 00:08:06.690
(When I asked her where she was going,)

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.360
(she told me she was going to be with Phu.)

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.392
(At first, I didn’t think too much about it.)

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.368
(I was happy
that she finally got her dream guy.)

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.608
(The strange thing is that
she has never contacted me since that day.)

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.168
(She was missing classes more often.)

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.648
(I only saw her during the exam.)

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.792
(Her personality had been bland all her life.)

00:08:41.816 --> 00:08:43.912
(She didn’t like being the center of attention.)

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.048
(She suddenly has people
following her everywhere.)

00:08:47.088 --> 00:08:50.304
(She doesn’t seem to be bothered by it.)

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.232
(I think she is doing something in secret.)

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.000
(Because she always has reasons
when she does something.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.368
(Because she always has reasons
when she does something.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.432
You have to help my friend.

00:09:05.456 --> 00:09:08.992
I’m worried that
Phu is planning to do something to her.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.288
I want to help your friend.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.888
But right now,
I have no evidence to charge them.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.856
If we let things go on like this,

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:22.860
won’t it be more dangerous to Ploy?

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.360
Then this is the only way we've got.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.824
We’ll solve the problem with money.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.176
Next person.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.512
Mommy Ploy

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.664
I feel like I haven’t given you everything.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.120
I promise.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.968
When I can sell my house and car,

00:10:12.992 --> 00:10:14.760
I’ll donate all the money to you.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.160
Mister.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.064
I don’t think
you should spend beyond your means.

00:10:25.232 --> 00:10:28.512
I can skip a meal for you.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.312
But I can’t stand not seeing you.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.144
Your time is up.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.216
I’ll see you.

00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:37.200
Please follow me.

00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:38.216
Your time is up.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.224
Next person.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.512
I’m so happy to see you today, Mommy Ploy.

00:10:56.536 --> 00:11:00.000
I’m your big fan.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.280
I’m your big fan.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.328
I have something to give you.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.592
You cannot do that.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.736
But this is a predicted paper for her exam.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.024
I noticed that you missed many classes.

00:11:17.048 --> 00:11:18.656
It’s still a No.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:20.752
What?

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.664
I’m sorry, Mommy.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:32.832
I don’t know I can’t give you gifts.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.832
Please don’t be mad or hate me.

00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:38.064
Please.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.328
Your time is up.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.112
What the heck?!

00:11:41.152 --> 00:11:43.192
Why is the time so short?

00:11:43.208 --> 00:11:44.152
Your time is up.

00:11:44.176 --> 00:11:45.872
I love you, Mommy.

00:11:45.896 --> 00:11:46.744
Please follow me.

00:11:46.768 --> 00:11:48.376
Don’t touch me. I can walk.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.648
SEE YOU AT 10 P.M.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.472
Be quiet.

00:12:24.496 --> 00:12:26.240
I’m here to help you get out of this place.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.736
Wait.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.896
I have something to tell you two.

00:12:36.704 --> 00:12:38.128
You can tell us later.

00:12:38.168 --> 00:12:40.912
Right now, we need to get out of here.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.552
Hold on.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.728
Don’t tell me you’re gathering evidence
for me to convict this cult.

00:12:52.784 --> 00:12:55.928
Gosh, Jued. I knew it.

00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:58.192
You are a super spy.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.632
DADDY PHU’S TEACHING.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.160
This is the intention of Phu and me
when we founded this cult.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.400
People want Phu to be their spiritual anchor.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.904
Phu wants me to be by his side.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.896
So I’m not going to leave this place.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:29.872
Ploy.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.368
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.456
Didn’t you tell me
you don’t believe in superstitions?

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.888
Why are you getting involved in this cult?

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.408
Back then, I didn’t understand it.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.528
Now, I get it.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.888
It’s not wrong to start a cult.

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.890
If we do it in the right and legal way.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.584
Phu and I share the same purpose.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:00.000
Laser Moon Group will be another option
for those who are looking for an answer in life.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.832
Laser Moon Group will be another option
for those who are looking for an answer in life.

00:14:00.864 --> 00:14:02.072
That’s all we want.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.896
Ploy.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.944
How have you changed so much?

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.496
Right now, you become…

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.232
I don’t know who you are anymore.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.176
I need to take you out of this place.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.912
What are you doing?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.440
Hey, are you a cop or a thief?

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:24.250
Let me go.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.080
Be quiet, or your followers will rush here.

00:14:26.104 --> 00:14:27.544
Let me go.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:28.704
Let me go.

00:14:28.728 --> 00:14:29.984
Let me down.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.376
Let me go.

00:14:33.416 --> 00:14:34.368
Let me go.

00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:35.952
Let me down.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.624
Leave me and Phu alone.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.712
Ploy.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:58.824
Please ask yourself again
if this is what you really want.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.976
Ploy that I know,

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.128
she’s not this kind of person.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.936
Double security for Mommy Ploy,

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.432
Comrade Yok.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.704
Sure, Daddy Phu.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:40.616
(After that night,
I have never seen them again.)

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.896
(Our Laser Moon Group is growing every day.)

Do you know this?

00:16:45.712 --> 00:16:48.656
Our group reached the break-even point.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.704
Thank you for always staying by my side.

To celebrate the success of Laser Moon,

I prepared a special event for you.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.210
I prepared a special event for you.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.760
Special event?

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.056
What is it?

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.600
Officer, do you have a plan to help my friend?

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.760
Wake up.

00:17:31.792 --> 00:17:33.304
My friend is in big trouble.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.016
In my upcoming special event,

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.280
I…

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.912
I’m going to…

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.768
propose to her.

00:17:47.808 --> 00:17:49.112
[BIG NEWS OF MUTE-POP,
DADDY PHU REVEALS HIS BIG SURPRISE.]

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:50.856
This shocks the entertainment industry.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.024
Getting married is good news.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.000
Officer, my friend is marrying
a leader of a weird cult.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.880
Officer, my friend is marrying
a leader of a weird cult.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:05.728
I don’t care.

00:18:05.744 --> 00:18:07.392
I want to file a report about this.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.000
If you don’t take any action,

00:18:09.032 --> 00:18:11.272
I’ll file a complaint against you for…

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.720
neglecting her problem.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.480
Do it.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.336
You have no proof
that she has a problem with it.

00:18:20.216 --> 00:18:21.340
What a letdown!

00:18:21.376 --> 00:18:23.136
Didn’t you say you were going to rescue her?

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.392
You are so useless.

00:18:26.408 --> 00:18:27.432
Useless.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:37.872
Lieutenant.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.448
Can I ask you something?

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.120
You have feelings for Ploy, don’t you?

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.904
Come on. Tell me the truth.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:57.608
You think I can’t read a young officer like you?

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.336
Yes.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:11.432
Then you don’t want her
to marry that cult leader, do you?

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.224
Yes.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.088
I’ll suspend you from duty.

00:19:21.128 --> 00:19:24.584
You’re unfit for duty
because of your personal problem.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.384
Wait, Boss. I…

00:19:29.416 --> 00:19:31.296
Are you going to disobey my order?

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.536
No.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:42.488
Our job is to ensure
the public’s safety and well-being.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.024
If you are not ready to do your job,

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.352
you should take a break from work.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:58.744
Right now, you are just a civilian.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.512
If you have something you want to do,

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.328
take this chance and do it.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.984
Wait, Boss.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.480
Are you saying…

00:20:36.376 --> 00:20:38.872
Please root for me, Great-grandfather.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.872
This is the makeup and hairstyle
Daddy Phu chose for you.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.000
Phu.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.880
Phu.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.256
Don’t you think the style is a bit too much?

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.160
No.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.280
I chose the dress for you.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.568
In tomorrow’s event,

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.352
I want you to look

00:21:16.384 --> 00:21:18.350
the most beautiful and perfect.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.872
Fine.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.312
Phu.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.512
I have a favor to ask.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:37.696
Sure.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.512
What is it?

00:21:41.232 --> 00:21:43.230
Tomorrow…

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.408
Can I not wear lenses?

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.496
But I think you look better without glasses.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.056
Is something bothering you?

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:14.096
You can tell me.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.336
I’m alright.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.728
What about you?

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.904
Do you have anything to tell me?

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:30.584
No.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:39.576
Daddy Phu, it’s time to choose your outfit.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.896
I’ll go choose my outfit.

00:23:31.304 --> 00:23:32.472
Why did the lights suddenly go off?

00:23:32.504 --> 00:23:33.672
I don’t know.

00:23:33.696 --> 00:23:35.272
Let’s check the electrical room.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.816
I guess I need to use the unlocking spell.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.496
It never fails me.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.976
A vase again?

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.360
Wait.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.448
It’s me, Wutkrai.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.280
What the hell are you doing?

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.000
Now, you have decided to be a thief?

00:24:33.032 --> 00:24:33.808
Yes.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.952
I have something I need to steal back.

00:24:35.992 --> 00:24:37.448
What? What is it?

00:24:37.472 --> 00:24:38.208
What do you want to steal?

00:24:38.232 --> 00:24:39.408
You.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.360
You hear it clearly, don’t you?

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.192
Don’t marry him.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.560
Let me take you out of here.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.056
Wait a sec.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.704
Here.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.296
This is all the evidence
I’ve gathered about this cult.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.144
Wait.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.088
When did you gather all the evidence?

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.544
To tell you the truth,

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.672
Since I met you that night.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:55.408
I thought Laser Moon Group
was a sincere support system for people.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.888
But in the end,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.608
Laser Moon Group does many illegal things.

00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:08.760
They are a loan shark.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.832
They threaten and use barbaric methods
to collect money from debtors.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.392
They also launder dirty money for crime lords.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.550
They are not different
from the Chantharusati Family.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:26.256
At first, I planned to expose them
at the wedding tomorrow.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:31.616
Since you are here, I’ll leave it to you.

00:26:34.064 --> 00:26:36.060
Right now, we need to get out of here.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.672
Are you awake?

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.432
Hang tight.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:23.880
Hey.

00:27:24.216 --> 00:27:26.220
Don’t you have a pocketknife?

00:27:26.256 --> 00:27:27.848
The one that police usually carry.

00:27:27.872 --> 00:27:29.624
You watch movies too much.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.840
Even if I had it,
they would have taken it away already.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.160
But they don’t know
that I know the unleashing spell.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.928
Stop it.

00:27:39.968 --> 00:27:41.930
It would be like when you tried
to stop your bleeding with a spell.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.912
If the robe becomes tighter,
we will be dead meat.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.560
I’m not afraid of death.

00:27:45.584 --> 00:27:47.400
You know I have hidden skills.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.088
I don’t know.

00:27:50.128 --> 00:27:51.768
I have a poor memory.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:54.568
Poor memory?

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.704
What about my love confession to you
last night?

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.912
Do you remember it?

00:27:58.968 --> 00:27:59.880
Huh?

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.664
What’s wrong with you?

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.392
Why are you mentioning it?

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:05.720
You don’t remember?

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.712
Do you want me to say it again?

00:28:09.736 --> 00:28:10.816
No.

00:28:10.848 --> 00:28:12.232
Why? You don’t like me?

00:28:12.248 --> 00:28:13.704
It’s not that.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.352
So what is it?

00:28:16.384 --> 00:28:18.448
Gosh, I…

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.280
To be honest,

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.776
I…

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.152
Ploy.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.024
Are you betraying me?

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.840
Didn’t you say you like me?

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.200
I’m your first love, ain’t I?

00:29:01.176 --> 00:29:02.192
Yes.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.720
I like you.

00:29:07.656 --> 00:29:09.660
I used to like you.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.712
But when I found out the truth,

00:29:16.336 --> 00:29:18.340
my feelings for you were gone.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.384
The truth?

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.968
What truth?

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.976
The truth is that…

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.504
this cult was founded to scam people.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.184
You exploit emotionally vulnerable people.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.320
You also launder money for crime lords.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.544
What you do is not different
from what Father did.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.872
I’m so disappointed

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.416
that you can’t see it.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:05.176
Everyone is doing this kind of stuff.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.824
I thought you would be smarter than this.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:17.672
If other women were in your place,

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:22.824
they would be happy and proud.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.848
You have everything that other women want.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.432
What else do you want?

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.096
You may be right.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.656
If other women were in my place,

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.680
they would be happy.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.720
But for me,

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.352
I now know what I want.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.624
Ploy, tell me.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.192
Do you love him?

00:31:07.224 --> 00:31:09.416
Phu, what are you doing?

00:31:09.448 --> 00:31:10.200
Please don’t do it.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:15.224
If you are gone, she will be mine.

00:31:22.144 --> 00:31:25.470
That knife cannot hurt me.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.944
Phu, are you out of your mind?

00:31:29.976 --> 00:31:32.600
If I have to go crazy to make you mine,

00:31:32.632 --> 00:31:33.480
I’ll do it.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.032
Are you losing your mind?

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.152
No.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:49.560
I’m just buying some time.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.320
Ouch.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:06.480
Hello.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.552
Ploy and the cop are running away.

00:32:08.568 --> 00:32:09.912
Don’t let them get away.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.512
Follow them.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.064
Hey.

00:32:19.088 --> 00:32:20.440
Why are the police here?

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.376
Everyone, look at this.

00:32:22.408 --> 00:32:25.016
This is the place where my friend is captured.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.592
Officer, you are here.

00:32:27.632 --> 00:32:29.784
Thank you so much.

00:32:29.808 --> 00:32:30.920
We are here to arrest you.

00:32:30.968 --> 00:32:34.344
We got a report that
you are causing a disturbance here.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:35.960
That’s not true.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.960
I didn’t do anything wrong.

00:32:36.984 --> 00:32:37.896
Sergeant, arrest her.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.072
The criminals are in the building, not me.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.720
Mommy Ploy.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.848
I’m very disappointed in you.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.384
Daddy Phu loves you so much.

00:32:53.408 --> 00:32:55.608
How dare you betray him?

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.360
If you can’t be Mommy for Daddy Phu,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.536
then I’ll do it.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:18.400
Mommy Yok.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.864

00:33:37.096 --> 00:33:39.352

00:33:46.096 --> 00:33:48.368

00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.056
What are you waiting for?

00:33:59.088 --> 00:34:00.000
Run.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.008
Run.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.248
What are you doing?

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.520
Stay behind me.

00:34:10.552 --> 00:34:12.864
No, you stay away.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.248
Phu won’t shoot me.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.152
Ploy.

00:34:20.264 --> 00:34:22.260
Do you love him that much?

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.848
What about me?

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.568
What about me, Ploy?

00:34:30.992 --> 00:34:32.440
How will I live without you?

00:34:32.576 --> 00:34:33.736
Phu.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.816
Phu, calm down.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.320
Put the gun down.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.720
So we can talk.

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:48.288
Since you no longer need me,

00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:54.568
I’ll leave you.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.472
Phu, no!

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.168
I think Phupar doesn’t know
how to shoot a gun.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.280
Or you have a special power.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.152
Hey.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.488
Hold on.

00:36:11.808 --> 00:36:13.472
You can’t die.

00:36:21.136 --> 00:36:23.248
Stop looking at me like that.

00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:28.192
I have special power.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.552
Don’t fall into sleep.

00:36:30.576 --> 00:36:31.632
Stay strong.

00:36:31.664 --> 00:36:33.120
I’ll go get help.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.576
See?

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.240
You have special power.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.440
The Pra Jiad armband I gave you.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:05.040
I’m happy

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.104
that it helps keep you safe.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.504
Ploy.

00:37:29.584 --> 00:37:31.580
How do you feel about me?

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.256
Are you not going to tell me?

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.448
I like you.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.088
Good.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.200
Hey.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:13.312
Talk to me.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.736
Phu.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.960
This will be my last request to you.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.016
Stop running.

00:39:15.304 --> 00:39:17.300
Surrender yourself to the police.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.416
I did wrong too.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.320
I understand you.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.576
You are just weak.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.584
You only look for emotional support.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.392
That’s all.

00:40:02.096 --> 00:40:03.008
Ploy.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.880
I’m sorry.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.440
I didn’t mean things to turn out this way.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.640
I got it now.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.312
I got it now, Ploy.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:36.344
I failed to manage the whole operation.

00:40:39.712 --> 00:40:40.488
Ploy.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.592
Run away with me.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.120
We will go to a place where no one knows us.

00:40:45.656 --> 00:40:47.104
After things die down,

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.616
we can come back and build a new cult.

00:40:49.664 --> 00:40:53.352
I guarantee
I won’t make mistakes again this time.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:56.288
Ploy.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.000
Thank you for making me realize it.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.520
Thank you for making me realize it.

00:41:01.296 --> 00:41:03.300
Let’s start again together, Ploy.

00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:19.496
You can have a new start in jail, asshole.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.592
Damn, I can see a ghost.

00:41:46.624 --> 00:41:48.376
I’m not a ghost.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.896
I’m not dead.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.072
The bullet only grazed me.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.896
It’s because I have sorcery power.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.752
What about the blood from your mouth?

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.680
That?

00:42:30.464 --> 00:42:31.992
Officer, this way.

00:42:32.024 --> 00:42:33.616
The criminal is in here.

00:42:44.048 --> 00:42:46.050
How long will you keep holding each other?

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:52.928
That’s how Laser Moon Group
was closed down.

00:42:52.976 --> 00:42:55.896
The whole story is relayed through my book.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:00.000
Sangchan, how do you feel
that this book became a best-seller?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.864
Sangchan, how do you feel
that this book became a best-seller?

00:43:02.864 --> 00:43:05.448
I’m very happy.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.576
I want to thank my readers.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.920
I think many people are curious about this.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:17.168
What happened to the people in the book
after the story ended?

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:22.248
I’ll start with Fay.

00:43:22.288 --> 00:43:26.792
After that live-streaming, she became viral.

00:43:26.808 --> 00:43:28.880
She gained hundreds of thousands
of new followers.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:34.520
For Officer Wutkrai,
his suspension from duty was extended.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.616
But he is idolized
by the junior officers in his department.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.620
He is a role model they want to follow.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.888
Ploy, the owner of the story.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.936
She went back to live her boring life.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.816
She asked me to publish her story
for everyone to read.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:00.000
Sangchan, you did a wonderful job
in relaying this story in detail.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.736
Sangchan, you did a wonderful job
in relaying this story in detail.

00:44:01.768 --> 00:44:06.344
It feels as if Ploy wrote the book herself.

00:44:06.368 --> 00:44:09.328
Yeah.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.984
Before we wrap things up,

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:15.112
do you have anything you want to say?

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:23.144
To be honest, I wrote this book

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.840
because I want it to be a lesson

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.864
for those who don’t have self-confidence

00:44:29.896 --> 00:44:31.820
and look for emotional support.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:37.896
It’s not weird for us
to feel insecure sometimes.

00:44:38.272 --> 00:44:40.270
And we turn to a higher power for help.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:46.776
That’s not a bad thing
if you don’t blindly believe it.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.008
If praying to a high power doesn’t work,

00:44:49.048 --> 00:44:51.010
then you should believe in yourself.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.920
Learn to love yourself.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:56.144
That’s a beautiful ending.

00:44:56.184 --> 00:45:00.000
Thank you, Sangchan,
for giving your time to our interview.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.096
Thank you, Sangchan,
for giving your time to our interview.

00:45:01.136 --> 00:45:03.136
Thank you for having me.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.152
My girlfriend is so cool.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.900
Are you sure about the pen name?

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.420
Why don’t you reveal
that you’re the real writer?

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:30.264
This is the right decision.

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:34.216
I don’t want people
to pay attention to my personal life.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:42.568
The person I want the most attention from is…

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.408
You are so flirty.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.656
Can you stop it?

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:54.368
For your next book,
why don’t you write about us?

00:45:57.656 --> 00:45:59.040
I’ll think about it.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:03.080
Then let’s go out on a date.

00:46:04.264 --> 00:46:05.632
Are you crazy?

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:07.408
I’m exhausted.

00:46:07.424 --> 00:46:09.096
Fay, you can come with us.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.376
Right.

00:46:11.408 --> 00:46:13.616
So I can play Extra #1 in your story?

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:15.656
I’ll go with you.

00:46:15.696 --> 00:46:17.552
Thank you for inviting me.

00:46:17.576 --> 00:46:19.144
Why are you playing along with him?

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:21.640
I want new content for my channel.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.648
Let’s go.

00:46:22.672 --> 00:46:23.104
Get up.

00:46:23.128 --> 00:46:23.768
Come on.

00:46:23.792 --> 00:46:24.544
No.

00:46:24.568 --> 00:46:25.312
Come on.

00:46:25.336 --> 00:46:25.920
No.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:29.608
Do you want to go to the beach?

00:46:29.656 --> 00:46:31.176
I want to lie down.

00:46:31.216 --> 00:46:32.376
Oh, you want to lie down on the beach?

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.392
Sure.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:34.784
Don’t force me to use the last resort.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.768
I want to lie down here.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:38.872
Stop it.

00:46:53.888 --> 00:46:57.032
We are Air Dolls.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.024
We are pretty.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.000
We are chic.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.256
We are chic.

00:47:00.288 --> 00:47:02.728
We are stylish, but we are not popular.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.568
Why don’t we pray to gods for help?

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.464
Deal.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.584
How will we know that the deva is powerful?

00:47:08.616 --> 00:47:10.000
You need to have faith.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:11.928
Our subscribers have almost reached 100,000.

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:14.888
Congratulations.

00:47:14.904 --> 00:47:16.360
Thank you, the deva.

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.728
THEY DISRESPECT THE DEVA.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.730
I am…

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:23.864
the deva.

00:47:24.496 --> 00:47:25.904
SO THE DIVAS ARE IN TROUBLE.

00:47:25.928 --> 00:47:27.544
I’ll curse you.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.752
Your life will be full of bad luck.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.776
Run.
