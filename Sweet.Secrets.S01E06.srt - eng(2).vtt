(The Masked Bride)

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.679
Who?

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.359
Yan.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.719
It's me.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.079
Mr. Li.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.520
Weren't you already leaving?

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.560
Your eyes aren't healed yet,
you're not steady on your feet.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.719
I waited downstairs.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:11.799
You came out now,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.280
are you thirsty?

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.519
Here.

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:22.400
Have a sip of water.

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:30.760
Mr. Li.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.319
I didn't expect

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.319
that someone so decisive and ruthless

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:36.959
could be so attentive.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.280
Give me your hand.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.959
This bracelet,

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.319
I wanted to give it to you before.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.120
If anything happens, shake it,

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.520
and I'll appear at once.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.560
Thank you.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.080
Mr. Li.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.080
It's getting late,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.080
I'll help you back to your room to rest.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.530

It's so lively outside.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.920
Why is Mr. Jing drinking alone here?

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.639
How about

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.319
I keep you company?

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.319
Does something trouble you, Mr. Jing?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.959
What's that?

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:36.560
A beast bone.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.279
When I was young,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.079
I was trapped
in Wujian's Beast Furnace Prison.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.360
My brother risked his life
to kill and save me.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:48.480
Since then,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.519
I've kept this with me.

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:52.879
As a keepsake.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.720
You fought side by side.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.120
You must be close.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:58.279
Close.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.120
Very close.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.319
So close we became enemies.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.720
Till death ends it.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.279
Perhaps

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.360
you each have your own pursuits.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.360
Miss Gu,

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:22.560
you're so attentive.

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:24.399
What do you want?

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.879
Are you suggesting
I cling to power, Mr. Jing?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.519
I won't deny your influence is immense.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.279
Nor will I deny

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.680
I'm pursuing what I want.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.519
I think

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:45.199
no matter the method,

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.480
it isn't shameful.

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:49.720
Don't you agree,

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:51.519
Mr. Jing?

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.160
Fine.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.680
Then I'll be your backer.

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:05.959
Take your hand away.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.800
Yan.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.879
You...

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.920
Here.

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.519
You've

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.480
been watching all night?

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:43.120
Here.

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:48.120
Slowly.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.920
I thought you might be hungry,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.199
so I made some breakfast.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:59.120
I didn't know what you like,

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.199
so I made a bit of everything.

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:06.120
I...

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.560
I can do it myself.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.600
I didn't expect

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.160
a man like you, Mr. Li,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.160
could actually cook.

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.000
How does it taste?

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:29.120
What did you say?

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:31.319
Yan,

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:32.800
don't you feel

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.399
something strange in your body?

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.160
I suddenly can't hear clearly.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:44.360
Mr. Li,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.879
am I going to die?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.800
No.

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.199
I'll make sure you see the light again.

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:52.120
Actually, I have an idea.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.519
But it might trouble you a little.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.680
What idea?

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.800
Marry me.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.000
What are you trying to do?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.800
Yan.

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:05.720
It's not that I'm being presumptuous.

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:09.399
But Miss Xia is one
of the three great spirit beasts.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.720
She was abandoned
by her husband on their wedding night.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.360
She delights in a bride's soul.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.399
Only by staging
a fake marriage between us

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.959
can we lure her out.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.720
Are you sure it will work?

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:29.240
If you think

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:30.959
this plan isn't suitable,

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.159
I'll think of another.

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:37.720
I trust you.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.759
Here.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.799
Have some milk.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.799
The sugar

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.519
seems a bit too much in the milk.

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:02.679
Does it?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.000
I don't think so.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.519
Are you laughing?

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.080
I'm not.

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:19.480
Mr. Li Motong,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.080
do you take Miss Lu Huayan
to be your wife?

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:23.320
I do.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.000
Miss Lu Huayan,

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:27.279
do you take Mr. Li Motong
to be your husband?

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:28.759
I do.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.159
Are you sure?

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:45.480
In this very church,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.799
a story once took place.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:50.679
It was the story of Miss Xia.

00:09:51.362 --> 00:09:54.562
Her husband
paid a great price to marry her.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.799
Yet she betrayed him,

00:09:58.425 --> 00:10:00.504
falling into another man's arms.

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:01.600
Not only that.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.879
It's said

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:07.799
that Miss Xia,
to live with her lover forever,

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:09.879
even joined him

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:11.279
to murder her husband.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.559
Taking advantage of his love for her,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.000
for her own selfish desire,

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:18.519
she cruelly sent him to the underworld.

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:20.000
As the old saying goes,

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.720
the most venomous is a woman's heart.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.080
That Miss Xia

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:25.279
was truly fickle and wanton.

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:26.960
She shifted her affections easily.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.200
Not only was her mind so vicious,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.519
she even murdered her own husband.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.080
A woman like that

00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:35.000
deserves to have her story written down,

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:36.399
as a warning to all.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.000
Her name should be nailed
to the pillar of shame forever,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.960
to serve as a lesson.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.679
I think that's a good idea.

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:45.120
Once our wedding is over,

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:47.200
we'll have it arranged.

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:51.720
Lord of Wujian.

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:56.519
Lord of Wujian.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:10:59.399
It seems you don't know me that well.

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:07.159
