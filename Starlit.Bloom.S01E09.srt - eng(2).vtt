(Lu Xingchen)
(I kissed Gu Liusu.)

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.599
(I actually kissed her!)

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.380
Hello?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.359
You kissed my Liusu?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.920
Your Liusu?

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.640
Didn't you say
you only fancy your goddess,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.319
not the current her?

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.680
I have no idea.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:30.280
I can't wrap my head around it.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.159
I just...

00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:33.888
(Microphone is enabled)
What do you mean?

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.640
I couldn't control myself.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.840
Hold on.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.040
She wouldn't think I'm a jerk,
would she?

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.519
Look in the mirror
and you'll know the answer.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:46.599
What do I do?

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.239
Tell me.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.719
How did she react to that?

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.599
She...

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.040
She...

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.680
She made no response.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.000
This is no fun.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.680

Hi, Lu Xingchen.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.599
Lu Xingchen!

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.400
How do I face him tomorrow?

00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:23.820
(7 July, Thursday, 03:06)

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.159
Never mind.

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:28.599
I'll just go to sleep.

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.590
I think we just tweak the last proposal,
and that'll do.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:34.960
Good morning, everyone.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.311
- Morning, Ms. Gu.
- Morning, Ms. Gu.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:37.080
Ghost!

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.960
Where?

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.159
There.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.439
How's the plan for tomorrow's shoot?

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.759
Ms. Gu, are you
in the right condition for it?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.960
I'll do it?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.319
She'll do it?

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.680
What on earth?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.159
I told you so, Ms. Gu.

00:04:02.488 --> 00:04:05.080
These years, many business owners
are personally getting involved.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.639
Be it livestreams or promos,

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.759
audiences do buy into it.

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.240
So?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.400
So we all agreed

00:04:10.422 --> 00:04:12.910
that this commercial
should be done by you.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.879
That way, we can maximize returns.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.120
But I've never done that before.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.639
What do you mean by that?

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.360
You've done many interviews and
magazine shoots in the past five years.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.920
This commercial shoot
should be nothing for you.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.519
Ms. Gu, believe in yourself.

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.319
You can do it.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.279
You got this.

00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:34.800
Here's the proposal.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.160
Since it's a two-person shoot,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.879
we even found you a guy.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.600
A guy?

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.120
What guy?

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.680
A male model.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.199
Ugh, no way. I can't manage it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.279
You'd better find a professional model.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.040
Alright, meeting adjourned.

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.680
(So that kiss really meant nothing.)

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.733
(He's a mere playboy.)

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:06.800
Xiaolu.

00:05:07.777 --> 00:05:09.270
Don't forget the shooting proposal.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:11.079
Su,

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:12.519
you're really off today.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.959
Are you having that?

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:18.680
Yeah.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.800
So I didn't sleep well last night.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:22.759
No wonder.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.920
Here, wear this
to conceal your tiredness.

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.240
Do I look that bad?

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.319
Very.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.879
Thanks.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.920
Don't mention it. I'll get back to work.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.199
Go on.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.519
Good grief, I guess I do look bad.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.920
How could it be this bad?

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.920
Hello? What's it, Baozhu?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.639
Same place today.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.720
I didn't sleep well last night,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.000
so I need to catch up on sleep.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.040
I've had everything arranged.
You have to be there.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.839
Play it by ear.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.519
Fine, I get it,

Tang Baozhu.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.040
If you want to drink,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.120
I can join you.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.920
But I have no need for a man.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.439

I will do it the rough way.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.000
I know a way to regulate and stimulate

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:22.360

(Lu Xingchen?)

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.440
Tang Baozhu, have you lost your mind?

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.200
What do you think?

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:54.480
Here he is!

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.240

Ms. Baozhu.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.840
It's you.

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:07.279
Yes, Ms. Liusu.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.440
It's Mo Li?

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:15.360
Tang Baozhu.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:16.600

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.519
What are you here?

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:20.799
Why can't I be here?

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:22.399
It's just a coincidence.

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:23.399
Come on, have a drink.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.933
Wouldn't that be such a coincidence?

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:28.879
I'm matchmaking Mo Li with Su.

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:29.919
What do you think?

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:32.200
They look good together, don't they?

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:34.120
Here, Ms. Liusu.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.679
A toast to you.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:37.120
I didn't expect Baozhu
to invite you over.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.000
I didn't expect it either.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.399
Not at all.

00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:45.600
Mo Li.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.519
Regarding the eight shops
I asked you about...

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.799
How's it going?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.519
I did ask them.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.399
Yet they still need

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:54.639
to verify it.

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:55.679
How reckless of him.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:56.120
Fine.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.400
You'll have an answer in two days.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.949
Okay.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.000
Don't use Gu Liusu as an excuse
to have fun here.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.279
How could you do this to my dad?

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.600
Mr. Mo!

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.840
How could you turn a blind eye to this?

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:11.639
Mr. Xingchen.

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:13.240
It's after hours now.

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:14.080
Besides,

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.320
nothing's happened.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.480
Lu Xingchen.

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:29.759
It's after hours.

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:30.720
What are you doing?

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:33.320
My stepmom is drinking here
at this late hour,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.200
and it'd hurt

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.749
the Lu family's dignity.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.177
So I'm here to keep an eye on her.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.840
You've finally admitted it.

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:42.559
Leave your aunt alone.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.639
Instead, have a drink with me.

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:45.720
Tang Baozhu,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.840
don't push your luck.

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:49.000
Kiddo, don't be so mean.

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:52.480
Come on.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.519
The show has begun!

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.960
Make some noise!

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:10.360
Well?

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.080
This...

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.000
Check that out!

00:11:20.444 --> 00:11:22.250
They're even feeding
the crowd with candies!

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:32.399
What are you doing?

00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:34.355
You'll use the washroom,
and I'll come with you.

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:35.639
What on earth is this?

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.840
What are you doing, Lu Xingchen?

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:39.000
I was enjoying the show.

00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:40.000
Forget about the show.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.759
Let go!

00:11:41.844 --> 00:11:43.888
I never thought
I'd bump into my nemesis here.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.120
So she's the nemesis
you were talking about?

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.360
Why? Do you know her?

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.480
I don't.

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:51.559
I'm counting on you to get
the exclusive raw materials, Mr. Lin.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.039
Looks like

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.960
you're a smart man.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.755
- May we have a pleasant cooperation.
- Yes.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.510
What are you doing?

00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:11.750
Trying to act cool, huh?
