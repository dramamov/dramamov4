[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.020
[Episode 25]

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.229
You don't understand
my painstaking efforts,

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.789
nor the righteousness I uphold
for both family and country!

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:49.850
Do you understand?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.759
The so-called family and country—

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.229
family comes before country!

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.640
You don't even care for your family—

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.370
what right do you have
to speak of righteousness?

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.640
What did you say?

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.680
Only a ruler

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.000
who governs with grace and composure

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.600
can be called a wise emperor.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.240
To be a good monarch,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.810
one must first be a good person.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.520
Kill her.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.370
This woman cannot be allowed to live.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.560
She said the exact same thing

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.829
as your mother did.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.750
Shut this wretch up!

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.190
Say one more insulting word to her
and you'll see.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.240
Suige,

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.840
I thought after your mother's death,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.970
you would finally come to your senses.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.750
But now there's another woman

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.710
like her by your side.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.310
Suige,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.150
for Susha's sake,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.030
I'm begging you—

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.400
this woman cannot stay alive.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.910
Kill her!

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.150
Listen!

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.490
You've already ruined

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.870
the first half of Feng Suige's life.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.240
I, Fu Yixiao, will never let you

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.430
ruin the rest of it!

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.470
Kill her!

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.120
Kill her!

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.120
Suige.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.560
Suige.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.910
Suige!

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.910
Wei Qingyu.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.560
Wei Qingyu...

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.080
I'm sorry.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.330
I lost control just now.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.530
Don't take what he said

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.630
to heart.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.110
Please don't be angry, alright?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.960
I should thank you
for what you did just now.

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.890
You stood up for me inside there

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.620
and considered things from my perspective.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.360
But what you said really does sound

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.620
just like something my mother would say.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.400
I think...

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.960
any decent person

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.670
would say the same thing.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.270
What?

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.480
Don't tell me

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.940
you want to call me Mother.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.480
I wouldn't mind

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.280
being someone like your mother.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.070
Alright.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.680
Stop crying.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.660
I'm not crying.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.440
It was just the sandstorm earlier.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.040
How could there be a sandstorm
inside the room?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.770
I don't care.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.930
There was a lot of sand anyway.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.510
Don't worry.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.890
With me here,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.430
no sandstorm will ever

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.360
reach you again.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.120
Ma Qiming,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.730
you know all of this, don't you?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.370
How dare you ask me
to come here to save him?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.850
You're leaving too?

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.750
I never imagined

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.160
you would treat Suige like this
all these years.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.920
And I never thought

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.050
Qingyu would die right in front of you!

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.440
Feng Pingcheng,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.750
from now on, we're completely done—

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.130
whether living or dead.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.630
Before I leave, I'll tell you

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.630
one last thing.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.630
All these years, the reason

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.159
I went all out to save you

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.920
was that Qingyu asked me to.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.870
You've been trying so hard

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.000
to defeat Qingyu,

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.430
yet he was the one

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.090
who actually saved your life.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.480
Move.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.450
It's been the whole day.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.600
How could so many people

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.630
still not have found His Majesty?

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.430
Your Majesty,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.030
the Imperial Guards said so.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.270
They've searched the entire Yujing City

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.920
and found no trace of His Majesty.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.760
No one knows

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.800
where he went.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.500
Prepare the carriage.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.310
I'll go find His Majesty myself.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.560
-So many people are looking for him.
-Yes.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.159
You won't make a difference.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.000
Leave us.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.000
Father.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.920
Where has His Majesty gone?

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.040
No need to ask so many questions.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.970
Pack your things

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.800
and take Chengyang out of the palace
for safety.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.870
What happened?

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.690
His Majesty is not in the palace.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.040
It's not safe here.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.810
Father,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.890
how could the palace be unsafe?

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.000
Is Feng Suige

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.130
acting crazy again?

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.830
He has no right to run wild

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.360
in the land of Sushan yet.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.720
Go tell Chengyang to pack up.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.150
You're leaving tonight.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.480
What exactly happened to His Majesty?

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.070
Father,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.120
what are you afraid of?

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.410
As long as you know nothing

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:26.950
about what I'm doing,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.040
you won't be implicated.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.630
At this point,

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.490
what are you still hiding from me?

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.600
You don't even

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.390
listen to me.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.570
Why won't you tell me the truth?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.080
What exactly are you planning to do?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.659
Why do you refuse to tell me?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.020
All these years,

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.960
Feng Pingcheng has also been
keeping secrets from me,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.480
never telling me

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.550
about his illness.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.670
Father,

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.200
what are you planning to do?

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.600
Tell me.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.480
I've had enough!

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.670
Am I not a member of the Zhuang family?

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.830
Am I not the Empress?

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.510
Am I not Chengyang's mother?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.720
Why has all the truth

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.080
been kept from me?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.200
Fine.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.440
I'm

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.620
going to avenge your brother.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.550
My brother?

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.390
Avenge?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.510
Your brother was killed

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.570
by Feng Pingcheng.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.670
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.370
He was executed for treason.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.550
Treason?

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.980
Feng Pingcheng caused his death!

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.520
Impossible.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.520
He committed treason.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.440
His entire clan should have been executed,

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.910
but Feng Pingcheng showed mercy

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.120
and spared the Zhuang family.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.440
Feng Pingcheng has long wanted

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.840
to eliminate our family.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.130
He fears our influence

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.630
and resents us
for the late empress's death.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.360
He's been holding hatred toward us.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.090
He's wanted to destroy our family
for a long time.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.480
If it weren't for your brother

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.220
taking all the blame,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.970
our family would have been wiped out
long ago.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.200
Impossible.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.270
Absolutely impossible.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.470
I wouldn't lie to you.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.790
I kept the truth from you

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.840
to protect you

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.700
and Chengyang.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.710
Now that you're asking,

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.630
I'm telling you everything.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.500
I don't believe it.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.870
Are you saying that all these years

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.730
I've been sleeping with our enemy

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.910
and serving the man

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.380
who killed my brother?

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.630
You two are my only children.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.260
I couldn't save your brother back then.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.870
I must keep you safe at all costs.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.510
Listen to me,

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.210
take Chengyang out of the palace now.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.910
I don't believe it.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.970
I'm going to ask him myself.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.480
Father,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.600
I can't leave.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.550
I'm the Empress. Where could I go?

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.120
I will avenge your brother myself.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.290
You don't need to hate anyone.

He's a man of his word

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.100
who never lies.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.350
But if he doesn't become the emperor,

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.150
how can we become a royal family?

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.350
I had no choice
but to ally with the Zhuang family—

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.310
to join forces with that old fox,

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.200
Zhuang Shen—

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.240
to fulfill my lifelong wish.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.330
Even His Majesty knows

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.400
one must never raise a tiger
that could later turn on him.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.480
Do you think Zhuang Shen

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.590
would let his grandson-in-law

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.240
have a powerful rival outside?

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.030
Once he's done using you,

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.310
he'll get rid of you!

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.070
How could you believe

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:36.680
that old bastard's nonsense?

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.370
I have proof of his treason!

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.830
If he dares go back on his word,

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.800
I'll drag him down with me!

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.270
He wouldn't dare.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.440
Father,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:46.790
by then,

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.920
our whole family will be able to

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.780
move to Xijing.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.530
Shut up.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.030
This is what the Murong family

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.000
rightfully deserves!

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.720
Shut up!

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.610
After being granted the title,

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:57.640
you'll never have to garrison

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.200
the freezing borderlands again.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.890
You can spend

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:00.680
-your remaining years in comfort.
-Shut up!

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.160
Father.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.240
Shut up!

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:06.960
Father.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.730
Father.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.860
Your leg...

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.570
Father!

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:11.900
Father,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:12.880
your leg...

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.070
Father,

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.960
if I don't do this,

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.110
you'll sooner or later
die worn out at the frontier.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.070
If Feng Pingcheng had even

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.880
a shred of decency toward you,

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.610
he wouldn't treat you this way.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.350
Am I wrong to want to kill him?

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.790
If he doesn't die,

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.880
you will, Father.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.060
You've worked hard your entire life.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:39.720
Don't you deserve

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.920
a few days of peace?

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200
I'm not doing this

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.830
for myself;

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.270
I'm doing it for the Murong family.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.350
I can't accept it!

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.720
Why should the Murong family

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.050
be trampled under the Feng family's feet?

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.480
How many times have I told you?

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.350
This is our fate.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:00.850
I don't believe it.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.200
Father,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.330
I don't believe in fate!

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.130
I've fought in battles all my life.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.350
I fear nothing—

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.820
not even death.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.330
The only thing I fear

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.830
is something happening to you.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.070
When

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.830
I'm wronged or mistreated,

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.350
I never dare to argue or complain,

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.160
always holding back.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.240
As long as you can live healthy and safe,

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.110
I'm content.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:43.800
Father...

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.790
Yao,

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.640
there's something you must remember:

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.550
everyone makes mistakes.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.030
But when you're wrong, you must admit it

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.110
and make it right.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.680
But as long as I'm still alive,

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.760
you don't need

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.240
to shoulder any burdens.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.780
As long as I'm here,

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.710
you don't need to be afraid of anything.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.830
All of you, come in!

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.640
I know you

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.200
are loyal to the Young Master.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.030
But

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
it's precisely this loyalty

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.030
that has led him to this deadly situation!

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.160
I'll put aside each of your crimes

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.880
for now.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.630
If you don't want him to die,

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.790
carry him back
to the Marquis's Mansion now

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.240
and keep a close watch on him.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.970

Yes, My Lord.

Go find me some thorny branches.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.480
Tomorrow I'll enter the palace
to see His Majesty

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.490
and ask him to punish me.

the cause of my brother's death.

Is what he said true?

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.480
Yes.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.860
what my father told me.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.000
and be trapped by power like you.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.700
My child's future path

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:00.070
will be determined by himself alone.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.280
All these years, the reason

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.760
I went all out to save you

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.330
was that Qingyu asked me to.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:24.280
You've been trying so hard

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.280
to defeat Qingyu,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.800
yet she was the one

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.460
who actually saved your life.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.440
I thought

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.659
I would undoubtedly win over you,

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:40.760
yet in the end, I still lost.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.550
Oh, right,

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.960
you don't like it when I use

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.780
the royal term to refer to myself.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.840
Fine.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.510
As you wish.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.810
As you wish.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.480
Our bond as husband and wife is long gone.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.760
Why did you have Ling Feng save me?

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.550
Why did you send him to save me?

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.070
You always said I've changed,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.230
that after becoming emperor

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.440
I was blinded by power.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.280
But it was you who never saw clearly.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.920
It was you who deceived yourself

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:32.360
with wishful thinking.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.110
I have always been who I am.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.150
My father starved to death.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.190
After he died,

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.070
my mother and I
wandered from place to place.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.610
I grew up in a refugee camp,

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:55.190
fighting with others for scraps of food
from the dead.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.070
If we hadn't fought for food,

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.150
my mother would've starved to death too.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:04.800
At that time,

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.400
I learned one thing:

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.550
If you don't fight

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.880
and seize,

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.630
you die.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.800
Wei Qingyu.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.440
Wei Qingyu.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.400
I'm leaving the world
I fought for with my life

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:30.510
to our son.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.750
Am I wrong?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.630
Am I wrong?

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.070
Am I wrong?

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.710
Am I wrong?

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.280
You're awake?

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:18.840
I haven't slept this peacefully

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.840
in a long time.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.590
You were talking nonstop

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.150
in your sleep.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.960
What did I say?

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:31.000
I won't tell you.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.000
I've remembered
all the good things you said

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.800
and forgotten

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.400
the bad ones for you.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.110
I hope I didn't

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:38.630
say anything bad

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:39.930
about you in my dreams.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.090
Then I definitely can't tell you.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.710
I hold grudges easily—

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:45.630
especially against you.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.570
You only hold grudges against me?

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.480
Of course.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:49.960
I've long forgotten

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.360
everyone else's,

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.030
but the ones about you—

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.360
I'll never forget.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.550
You too.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.070
What do you mean?

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.770
You can only hold grudges against me.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.290
Don't ever keep the hurt

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.830
others caused you in your heart,

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.760
and don't ever use it to hurt yourself.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.270
Why are you laughing?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.730
I just thought of an old saying:

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.630
comb your hair once,
and all your worries fade;

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:52.890
comb it twice, and you'll be free
from sickness and sorrow;

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.110
comb it three times,
and we will live in harmony;

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.910
comb it four times,
and we'll be together forever.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.800
It's obvious

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.730
you made up the last ones yourself.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.480
Who would want
to be together with you forever?

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.190
Once I've avenged my mother,

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.070
we'll live in harmony

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.890
and be together forever. Alright?

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:21.960
Alright.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:28.880
Miss Yixiao.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.620
Miss Yixiao, are you in your room?

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:32.230
I just went to His Highness's chamber

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.150
to look for him,

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.760
but he wasn't there.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.630
Do you know where he went?

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.030
I have something urgent.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.440
Well...

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.190
Why are you looking for me?

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.670
Nothing.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.090
Your Highness,

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.710
I do have

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.420
some small matters to report.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.880
The elite soldiers of the Feng Battalion

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.480
have assembled

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.440
at the city gates,

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:54.960
and the Hound

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.880
has come back with the brothers

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.230
in the Qiongqi Unit.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.110
Got it.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.400
Tell the Hound to wait for me
in the study.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:00.960
Yes.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.590
No rush.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:09.590
[Linfang Hall]

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:10.650
I didn't expect you

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.440
to send word

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.670
and ask to see me.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:15.920
The flowers are blooming beautifully
today.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.440
Your Highness, won't you pick a few?

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.170
Your Majesty,
you did that on purpose yesterday?

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:21.840
I was certain

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.630
you wouldn't dare tell Xia Jingshi

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:25.490
about our meeting in the Library,

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.610
so I lent you a hand.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.840
Did you enjoy

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.800
those Susha delicacies?

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.800
Your Majesty, I don't deserve

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.840
such great favor.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.840
Please don't trouble yourself

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.370
with trivial matters like this
in the future.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.060
How could anything

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.800
concerning you be a trivial matter?

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.400
No matter how big or small the matter,

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.230
it's between His Highness

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:55.000
and me—

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.270
it has nothing to do with you.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.480
What?

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.350
Are you angry?

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.360
Are you angry that I ruined things

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.960
between you and Xia Jingshi?

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.250
He shows no appreciation for your beauty,

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.590
yet you still care so deeply for him.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.650
I've said everything I needed to say.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.260
I'll take my leave now.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.960
What's so great about Xia Jingshi

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.000
that all of you treat him

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.330
like the moon in the sky?

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.190
Let go of me!

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.490
All you Xias are sick!

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.230
One's heartless,

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.560
and the other's insane!

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.280
Heartless?

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.070
So you've finally seen

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.600
Xia Jingshi's true nature.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.840
My Lord,

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.150
your legs are weak.

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.630
Why did you put yourself through this?

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.830
Is His Majesty

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.190
in Changchun Palace?

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.440
Yes.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.050
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.200
Your Majesty.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:22.710
Get lost!

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.240
Your Majesty,

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:32.370
Elder Marquis Murong is here.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.670
I won't see him.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.150
He's carrying thorny branches on his back—

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:39.000
it seems he's here
to ask for your punishment.
