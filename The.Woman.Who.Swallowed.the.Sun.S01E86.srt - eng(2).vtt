WEBVTT

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.510
Let go of me, you punks!

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.540
Let go!

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.250
Where are you taking me this time?

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.320
It'd be in your best interest
to come quietly.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.020
If you make a scene, you'll get hurt.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.820
Do you really think
you'll get away with this?

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.750
Let's just go quietly.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.960
- See that he gets there safely.
- Yes, sir!

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.890
You punk! Get your hands off me!

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.330
You punk!

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.010
You're going to lock me up in here,
is that it?

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.880
You jerk. I'll just...

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.520
Consider this a time for reflection.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.350
Or a chance to look back on your life.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.090
Reflecting on the life you've lived
with regret and repentance...

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.430
might be a meaningful way
to spend your time.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.430
I regret entrusting an important position
to a scumbag like you,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.400
and I'll spend my time repenting
for ever trusting you.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.230
Well, that's not a bad place to start.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.940
Who put you up to this? Was it Kyung Chae?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.870
If you two cooked this up together...

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.470
That's not important.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.110
What's important is that from now on,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.750
you're going to lose the chairmanship
of Mingang Distribution.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.850
You think I'm going to let you
get away with this?

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.420
The day I get out of here,
you're all dead.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.090
That's not going to happen.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.890
You'll live out
the rest of your days here,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.260
and this is where you'll die.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.760
What did you say?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.800
You punk! Let me go!

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.060
Let go!

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.170
Kim Sun Jae, get back here!

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.900
Stop right there!

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.640
Get back here, you punk!

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.140
Do you think I'll let you
get away with this?

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.840
Stop, you punk!

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.910
You punk! Let me go!

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.820
The chairman is late tonight.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.690
You haven't heard from him, have you?

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.590
He didn't say anything.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.230
Besides, I'd think you'd know his schedule
better than anyone, Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.160
Manager Gong has a point.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.670
The person Father trusts the most
in this family ought to know.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.340
What would the people he's cast aside
possibly know?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.010
Did you do something to upset him?

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.640
Could it be about changing his will?

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.380
Are you suggesting it's my fault
the chairman is late and hasn't called?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.790
Come on. Not this again.
Dad's allowed to have a private life.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.220
He can be late sometimes.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.090
He's right, you know.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.030
I've found that men have a private life
that women don't know about.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.300
Looks like he'll be late,
so let's start to eat.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.270
I have documents to review anyway.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.340
- Still, we can't. The chairman...
- Let's just start to eat.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.770
You should eat something.
I heard you skipped lunch.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.260
What's going on?

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.830
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.670
Yes?

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.180
It seems the chairman isn't coming home.
Should I lock up for the night?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.050
He's not one to stay out all night
without calling.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.820
Has this ever happened before?

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.420
Yes, quite often before you were married.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.390
Really?

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.090
Leave the main gate unlocked.
He might still come home late.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.700
What did you just say?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.930
You locked up my father?

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.600
So that's why
he didn't come home last night...

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.270
I told you...

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.570
that I'd do whatever it took
to make you the acting chairman.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.840
But you didn't have to do it like this.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.880
The means don't matter. Only the results.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.110
As long as he's there,
the chairman can't change the will or...

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.180
destroy it.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.720
But to be imprisoned like this...

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.820
means he was dragged off
without knowing where.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.420
Don't be a hypocrite.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.590
You tried to have him put away
for dementia.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.100
That was because I really thought
he had dementia.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.170
The nursing home was a last resort,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.970
but this is completely different!

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.240
Fine. Should I let the chairman go?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.310
If I do, he'll just change the will,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.980
and you'll never get the chairmanship.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.050
You punks...

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.780
Hey! You punks, open this door!

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.420
Do you have any idea who I am?

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.960
I'm Min Doo Sik!

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.590
The chairman of Mingang Distribution,
Min Doo Sik!

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.260
You think I'll let you get away with this?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.100
If you want to live, open this door!

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.810
Gosh, you're loud, you old geezer.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.210
You punks.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.740
When I get out of here,
you're all going to pay.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.880
Who do you think you're messing with!

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.350
Just you wait.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.290
I'll make you regret this
for the rest of your lives.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.260
Looks like the old geezer's sleep-deprived
and talking nonsense.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.760
Let's let him get
a few more hours of rest.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.790
Good idea.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.500
You punks...

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.900
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.270
Let go!

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.070
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.500
Let go of me!

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.050
What did you give me?

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.290
I said, what kind of drug is this?

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.820
You punks, I'll just...

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.080
If you don't care about the chairmanship,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.520
then I'll let him go right this second.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.590
And then there's Lucia.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.360
She started at Mingang with nothing
and clawed her way up to become the CEO.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.430
The chairman is just itching
to give her more power.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.240
Just look at your own situation.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.770
You've been forced out of the company
and you're jobless.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.140
You're in no position to worry about him.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.450
But still...

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.450
I have to...

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.690
see for myself.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.970
What's wrong with him?

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.510
- Is he sick or something?
- He's just out from a sleeping pill.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.850
I had no idea you'd go this far.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.090
(CEO Jung Lucia)

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.360
Hello?

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.300
(Mingang Distribution)

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.560
What's going on?

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.970
Your father didn't come home last night.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.040
Why is this about?

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.680
She called us here because
Father stayed out all night.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.180
Gosh, I thought it was something serious.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.110
Try calling him then.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.680
I can't reach him. His phone is off.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.050
Does anyone have any idea what happened?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.690
Disappearing is my father's specialty.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.690
After his brain surgery,
he switched hospitals without a word.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.490
He really freaked us out.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.700
And honestly,
so what if he stays out for one night?

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.630
I was thinking it was a big deal.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.800
Shouldn't you handle this yourself
instead of talking to us?

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.470
Strictly speaking, it's a matter
between you and your husband.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.880
Exactly! It's a marital problem!

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.610
Speaking of which,
is there trouble between you two?

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.510
There's always a reason
when our father does something like this.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.160
Anyone who sees you might think
you're off to have an affair.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.990
You got all gussied up
just to go to the office.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.760
My lovely wife.
I'm a non-executive director.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.060
I must look the part.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.660
Go to the meeting and come straight home.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.000
You know what'll happen
if you stray, right?

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.670
What kind of crazy talk is that?
Get sidetracked? Me?

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.010
Am I a leaky bucket?

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.110
That woman from our in-laws' wedding,
that "Stainless" woman, or whatever,

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.880
I'm telling you not to meet up with her
and get all flirty.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.380
It's not Stainless, it's Stella.
Madam Stella.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.390
That Stella woman is
also a non-executive director, isn't she?

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.060
Don't you two dare
get up to anything funny.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.820
Up to anything? What?
You have a vulgar mind!

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
We’re not in that kind of relationship.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.070
"We?" Since when are you
and that woman a "we?"

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.000
It's a collective term.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.200
Like "our customers," "our citizens,"
"our people."

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.240
And besides, she's not just some "woman."
She's Madam Stella.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.510
Madam, my foot!

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.580
Just remember that the only "we"
that includes you, Oh Pan Sool,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.610
is me, Yang Mal Sook. Don't you forget it.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.380
Or else I'll have my way,
you handsome old geezer.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.950
No violence now, you sexy old thing.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.650
Violence is forbidden!

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.720
Knock, knock.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.360
Madam Stella. Knock, knock.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.230
Might I be so bold as to ask
what the rest of your schedule is today?

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.440
I told you to call me just Stella.
That way, I can call you Pan Sool.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.140
I'd be too embarrassed.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.170
Well then... Ms. Stella.
I mean, just Stella.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.640
The meeting's over,
so where are we off to now?

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.350
My schedule is clear.
How about you, Pan Sool?

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.720
I am also very free.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.290
Then would you like to get
a cup of tea with me?

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.920
Sounds great.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.060
In fact, let's go all out
and have ten cups.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.090
I know a place with great cappuccinos.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.860
A little tea time just for the two of us,
shall we say?

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.800
Just the two of us in the whole nation?

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.270
Yes, just the two of us.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:35.940
That's a killer wink.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.580
All right, let's go.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.180
All right, coming through!
Make way for Madam Stella!

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.860
The ambiance is nice, the coffee's great,

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.800
and the company is even better.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.400
And having you here, Stella,
makes it the best.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.670
Maybe it's because I'm all alone,
with no husband or children,

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.380
but when I meet
someone wonderful like you,

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.080
you don't feel like a stranger at all.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.380
Does that mean...

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.380
that I'm a special special person?

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.850
My heart's about to pound
right out of my chest.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.420
It's pounding like this.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.330
That reminds me.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.330
Are you planning to keep your stake
in Mingang Distribution?

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.700
It's not like holding it is going
to make you rich.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.100
My daughter and son-in-law told me
to hold onto it for dear life.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.340
I sold my Mingang stake,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.640
invested elsewhere, and made a killing.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.950
A killing, you say?

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.710
Just how much did you make?

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.850
Could you tell me specifically?
Like, down to the exact cent?

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.360
I'll go anywhere you need me.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.560
Anywhere.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.100
I'm so enchanted
I can't hear a single word.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.370
Don't stop talking.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.480
So sweet...

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.680
Your whispering tickles.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.780
So does this mean Oh Pan Sool...

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.250
is going to entrust his Mingang stake
to you?

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.420
I've laid the bait,
but there's no telling if he'll take it.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.600
Forget that. What's this
about Min Doo Sik not returning home?

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.070
I know, right? The fact
that we can't reach him all day...

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.430
is bothering me.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.870
What's with him all of a sudden?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.410
He's done so many terrible things
that maybe the devil came to collect?

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.810
Right before he changes the will...

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.610
and has found out about
Kim Sun Jae's double-entry ledger,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.410
he just went off the grid.
Don't you find it strange?

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.490
The timing is suspicious, I'll admit.
Everything's fine, then suddenly this.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.260
If Chairman Min Doo Sik doesn't show up,

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.030
Min Kyung Chae or Kim Sun Jae
has something to do with it.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:48.170
Part of me hopes he was dragged off
to be held captive until he dies.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.270
But if that happened,
it would interfere with our plans.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.800
So, like it or not,
we have to find Min Doo Sik.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.780
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.010
Charges may apply after the beep.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.790
The chairman still hasn't come home.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.760
Do you happen to know where he is?

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.200
Why are you asking me?

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.440
Shouldn't his precious little wifey
know that?

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.810
If you know something
and are just playing dumb,

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.940
I won't let it slide.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.210
Hey.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.810
I mean, Stepmother.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.520
You must feel great after kicking me out
of the company.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.750
Can you even spare a thought for Father?

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.560
I kicked you out of the company
because you had it coming.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.990
If you feel you were wronged,

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.390
you should look
at what you did to earn it.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.260
Besides, who will take care
of the chairman if not me?

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.030
Especially since his so-called children
are worse than strangers.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.640
And who do you think made us that way?

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.540
Who drove a wedge between us
and pitted us against each other?

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.780
I'll ask you one more time.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.150
You don't know where the chairman is?

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.210
I believe I already told you.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.380
I said I don't know.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.170
The chairman is unreachable.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.010
Do you happen to know where he is?

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.110
Unreachable?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.610
What? How did that happen?

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.710
So you didn't know?

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.080
Of course. How could I possibly know?

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.320
What would a nobody like me know?

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.720
I've been completely cut loose.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.620
As you well know,

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.460
I've been living with my tail
between my legs lately.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.200
He probably just went off somewhere
to get some fresh air.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.600
Our dear CEO has so much to worry about.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.480
Aren't you getting on?

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.750
Then I'll go ahead.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.460
(Mingang Distribution)

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.600
Hey.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.200
There's something suspicious
about Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:43.070
I met with Madam Jang yesterday,
and we talked about the same thing.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.010
You don't think...

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.210
they've locked Chairman Min up
somewhere, do you?

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.910
If it were to stop him
from changing his will,

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.920
it's a possibility.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.950
Besides, if Kim Sun Jae's
double-entry ledger was found out,

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.650
he'd be completely cornered.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.260
Where on earth could they
have hidden Chairman Min?

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.190
If they want to make sure
he's never found,

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.600
it won't be anywhere nearby.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.830
Our only option is
to trace Chairman Min's last movements.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.870
The last footage of the chairman leaving,

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:18.380
and all the CCTV footage
in front of the company.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.540
The footage should still be there
since it was a few days ago.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.680
The chairman leaving the building...

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.150
Here it is.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.460
It shows he dismissed his aides
and left work by himself.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.160
What about the CCTV cameras out front?

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:40.030
We can confirm that the chairman
got in his car and drove off.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.970
Wait, are you saying...

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.600
he left in the car
driven by his chauffeur, Mr. Kim?

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.040
I assume so.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.240
It's caught in the camera's blind spot,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.910
so I can't confirm who the driver is.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.350
So there's no proof
that Mr. Kim was the one driving?

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.020
Exactly. We can't know for sure.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.430
So it might not have been Mr. Kim driving,

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.030
but someone else was behind the wheel.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.170
To pull that off, they'd have to know
the CCTV camera's blind spot well,

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:20.070
which ultimately means
it was an inside job.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.450
Is it true no one's heard from Dad yet?

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.220
You think someone would know
where he is and not say anything?

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.290
It's just so weird.
Why would Dad just disappear?

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.220
Does this make any sense at all?

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.260
Your father doesn't have
much common sense.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.860
Remember that whole dementia incident?

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:47.030
Would a sensible person act like that?
Wouldn't you agree, Manager Gong?

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.270
I couldn't say.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.240
That's because you and Ji Seop
put him through so much.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.800
Dad had no choice but to act that way.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:57.140
Se Ri, we only let it slide
because he's family.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.510
But your father is a strange man.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.250
No matter how strange he is,
how could he vanish overnight like this?

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.990
Come on, he's probably just
cooling his head off somewhere nice.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.690
It's not like he's short
on money or anything.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.390
He's probably enjoying fine dining
with a killer view.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.730
You’ll see. I’m right about this.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.520
You expect me to eat this dog food?

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.020
You eat this crap!

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.060
Darn it!

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.960
These punks!

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.230
Kyung Chae doesn't know
where Dad is either?

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.240
How would she know?

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.340
If anyone were to know,
it would be his wife.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.540
That's true.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.910
A wife should know what's going on
with her husband.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.250
But your stepmother looked like
she was completely in the dark.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.850
I guess their marriage is on the rocks?

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.320
Maybe that's why he left home.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.720
Why? Where are you going?

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.560
I'm going to go ask Kyung Chae myself.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.190
Come on. She hasn't slept a wink in days.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.330
She just finally managed
to get some sleep.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.600
Please, just let her be.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.240
I think she's had insomnia
ever since she lost her job.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.840
She went from being the boss
to nothing overnight.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.800
How did you get here?

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.040
Why are you so surprised?

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.110
What? You look like you've seen a ghost.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.810
This wasn't me.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.480
I didn't even know you were there, Father.
It was Lawyer Kim...

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.820
If you knew Lawyer Kim locked me in there,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.220
how could you, my own daughter,
pretend you didn't know?

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.950
I was going to let you out anyway.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.960
You're the one who tried
to throw me into a nursing home...

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.160
the minute you thought I'd lost my mind.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.360
And now you expect me to believe that?

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.730
Do you think
I'll just let you get away with this?

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.570
You were probably hoping
I'd just die locked up in there.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.900
When I die, I'm not going down alone.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.640
I'm taking you with me.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.840
Just you watch.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.910
I can't speak for the others,

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.580
but I'm definitely taking you down
with me.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:20.980
Where are you going?

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.660
Father.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.110
You viper.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.540
How dare you call me Father?

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:55.110
Why?

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.480
Did you come to gawk
at the pathetic state your father is in?

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.450
Did you come to see
if I was dead or alive?

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.990
And you call yourself my daughter?

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.130
Aren't you afraid of what will come?

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.830
The second I get out of here,
you're out of my house.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.240
I will never let you get away with this!

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.240
You brought this all on yourself.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.280
You deceived and tested your children.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.980
Why couldn't you have just acted
like a father in the first place?

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.980
This is exactly why I was trying
to change my will.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.020
If you become the chairman and take over
Mingang as the will states,

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.990
I've finally seen what a disaster
this company would become.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.130
Over my dead body...

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.300
will you ever own Mingang.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.000
I will never let you
have the chairman's seat.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.830
Go ahead and try.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.440
But that's assuming
you ever get out of here.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.310
Do you really think
you can get out of here, Father?

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.480
What? Are you saying...

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.880
This is the last time.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.450
I'm never coming back here again.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.790
Because even if it's over your dead body,
I will become chairman of Mingang!

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:10.590
You little brat!

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.190
Get back here!

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.530
Min Kyung Chae, stop right there!

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.260
You little brat!

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.070
Stop!

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.400
We haven't heard
from the chairman in days.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.640
We can't just keep waiting like this.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.370
If we can't let this go on, then what?

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.310
Are you suggesting we form a search party?

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.640
We should file a missing person's report.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.950
And what about Mingang's stock tanking
the second you do?

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.920
And you call yourself CEO?
Didn't you even consider that?

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.790
Who cares about the stock price right now?

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.150
We don't know
what could've happened to him.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.190
If something had happened to him,
we would've heard.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:49.560
If he were in a car accident,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.260
a hospital or the police
would have called.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.330
Hey, Soo Jung has a point.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.300
We would've gotten
an emergency call by now.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:01.610
Let's just wait a little longer.
Dad might've just gone off the grid.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.010
How does that make any sense?

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.910
What's so unbelievable?

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.710
He's just relaxing and will be back soon.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.050
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.050
It's just making things tense around here.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.420
Hey, Manager Gong, what's for dinner?
I'm starving.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.250
I've already set the table.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.120
It is?
What's everyone waiting for? Let's go eat.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.860
Everyone, get up! Let's go eat!

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:23.660
What are you all doing? Come on, hurry up.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:27.230
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.340
Unbelievable.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.650
How can you all eat at a time like this?

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.280
I'm having no problem at all.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.750
Don't be like that and eat something.
Starving yourself only hurts you.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.590
He's right. You can't face trouble
on an empty stomach.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.890
Hey, come on. Se Ri, you eat up too.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.030
It's not like Father's going to care
if you starve yourself.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.330
You're all unbelievable.
What kind of family acts like this?

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.770
You're his children.
Does his empty seat mean nothing to you?

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.180
What do you think you're doing?
How dare you sit there?

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.690
It's an empty seat.
What's the big deal if I sit here?

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.960
Go sit in your own seat.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.390
Leave that for the chairman
when he comes home.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.790
And who says the chairman is coming back?

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.960
What's that supposed to mean?

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.100
Forget about the chairman who isn't here,
and start worrying about yourself.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.040
With the chairman gone, who in this house
do you think is on your side?

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.080
Are you going to kick me out
now that the chairman is gone?

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.550
If you don't want to get kicked out,
watch your step.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.680
This is my house.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.920
Legally, you're all registered under me.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.590
I am your mother.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.700
What's so funny?

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.070
I was wondering
what we did to deserve a mother like you.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.080
What did you just say?

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.280
A stepmother my own age.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.880
And a former subordinate, at that.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.420
Wasn't becoming
the lady of the house enough...

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.650
after seducing the old chairman?

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.520
Now you want us to treat you
as our mother?

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.290
You're far too greedy.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.620
I've put up with you until now
for Father's sake.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.190
But I don't have to do that anymore.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.720
Because, as of today, this is my seat,

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.530
which means you're nothing now.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.220
