00:01:00.622 --> 00:01:01.400
Hello?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.840
Ms. Gu. Someone is here to see you.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.359
Who is it?

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.430
- Hey, beautiful. We meet again.
- Hang on a sec.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.959
Sorry, Ms. Gu, I couldn't stop him.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.159
I didn't expect you
to be the boss of GL.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:16.000
Mr. Lu Xingchen,
I don't recall inviting you.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.560
So this is the hospitality
at the company

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.111
that Tang Baozhu spoke so highly of.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.799
Baozhu?

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.040
Hello, my bestie.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.439
Xingchen.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:30.879
This is your Aunt Liusu's company.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.159
From now on,
if you need anything, talk to her.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.519
Tang Baozhu, when did I ever say

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:40.719
- he could come to me about anything?
- Keep it up.

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:47.200
The elder wants the younger to work.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.480
He doesn't want to join Xinghan.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.280
So they keep fighting.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.959
I just wanted to ease the tension,

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.079
so I made a suggestion.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.840
But, the elder agreed.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.920
Why are you so unmotivated?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.280
You're a man, yet you have
no sense of responsibility.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.000
If you're still like this,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.439
go back to France.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.120
I've already graduated.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.519
I have the right
to live my life on my own terms.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.189
I want to stay in China.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.639
Why don't you cut off my credit cards?

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.719
From now on,
I won't need a penny from you.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.199
Then go work at Xinghan.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.199
No.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.439
I'm not going to Xinghan.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:17.800
Anywhere but there.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.711
Anywhere else is fine.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.680
Honey,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.319
don't be mad.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.039
How about letting him
try working with Liusu?

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.800
See,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800
they both studied design.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.479
Their majors even match.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.311
Most importantly,
she can keep an eye on him.

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.919
The kid is stubborn.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.360
I'm afraid he won't agree.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.840
Perfect.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.680
Let his aunt discipline him properly.

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:47.639
Leave it to me.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.639
Tang Baozhu,

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.639
you're not even his stepmother yet,

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.360
and you're already so invested.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.159
Bestie,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.599
you should know,

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.240
stepmothers and stepsons
have never gotten along.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.800
Give me two months.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.039
I'll win over Lu Xingchen,

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.439
get the wedding done smoothly,

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.080
and who knows, maybe next year

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.000
you'll be holding a little nephew.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.560
I can't wait for that day.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.240
Nope.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.800
Not a chance.

00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:18.360
If you want a kid,
you could have one first.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.159
You really think Lu won't marry you?

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.759
I just don't want to wear
a wedding dress with a baby bump.

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.560
Besides...

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.000
Lu is already in his fifties.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.560
Who knows if he can even manage it?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.120
Tang Baozhu, what are you saying?

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.840
Don't be fooled by all the fighting
between them.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.000
Deep down, he really treasures his son.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.560
How about this?

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.080
No more than three chances.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.560
Give him three shots.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.840
If he messes up again,

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.639
I'll handle Lu myself.

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.120
Aren't you looking for a secretary?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.000
You've already
been through 3,280 of them.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.319
Why not let him
get some practice at your company?

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.439
Tang Baozhu,

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.319
you really want
your stepson to be my secretary?

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.960
How does that sound reasonable?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.240
Perfectly reasonable.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.759
What's with that look?

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.240
Are you rejecting me?

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.639
(Bestie...)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.560
(I can't exactly tell you
that mediocre guy)

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800
(is actually Lu Xingchen, can I?)

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.959
Just three chances.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.800
You are the best.

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:27.399
Work hard.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:28.480
Bye-bye.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.680
(What are those two whispering about?)

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:34.800
(I can't do anything about her.)

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.800
Here's my resume.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.160
Please check it.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.509
Why so hostile?

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.155
Did you eat firecrackers for breakfast?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.639
What you need to do now
is leave my desk.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:01.560
Leaving.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.160
And then?

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.839
Keep your distance from me.

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:17.560
I saw the security footage.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.959
That night, actually...

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:19.639
Stop.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.879
I don't want to hear another word

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.759
about that night.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:28.079
Mr. Lu, just forget about it.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.720
If you think something like that

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.720
can be tossed around casually,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.000
then I don't mind letting people know

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.759
you really are just average.

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:42.319
Fine.

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.639
You refused to hear me out.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.519
Don't blame me for not warning you.

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:48.360
Anyway,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.160
I promised Baozhu

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.279
to keep you at the company.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.759
But we'll set three rules.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.839
First,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.240
you are not allowed
to question any of my orders.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.480
Second,

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.079
forget your old identity.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.879
From today, you're just a secretary.

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:00.839
Third,

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:03.399
your flings outside are
none of my business,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.240
but you cannot mess around
with my employees.

00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:10.070
Mess around with employees?

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.120
Flings?

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.120
Why does it sound like

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.040
you know me so well?

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.000
Are you going to read

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.560
my resume or not?

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.480
I'm really not that mediocre.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.519
Take a look.

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:36.399
Fourth,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.519
don't mess with Tang Baozhu again.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.399
Xiaolu,

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:43.600
get our Secretary Lu

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.800
a desk

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.120
separate from the others.

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:47.399
Thanks.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.720
Alright.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.879
Secretary Lu, please come with me.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.120
Off to work.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.079
(It's actually pretty fun teasing her.)

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.519
What sin did I commit to deserve this?

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.839
I knew meeting him
would bring me bad luck!

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.199
How is Starry Sea's designer holding up?

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.399
We're handling it.

00:07:19.244 --> 00:07:20.630
She really is from your company?

00:07:20.911 --> 00:07:22.600
I thought it was just some rumor online.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.120
The night I met Gu Liusu

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.680
wasn't what you think it was.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.360
It probably looked messy...

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.279
Lu Xingchen!

00:07:40.777 --> 00:07:42.070
What are you two talking about?

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.040
Work stuff.

00:07:45.688 --> 00:07:46.750
Get me a glass of water.

00:07:48.444 --> 00:07:50.360
Ugh, I can't hear a word
of what they're saying.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.000
Ms. Gu,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.279
I've been here all morning.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.519
Let me learn something useful.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.000
Learn to shut up.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.640
(Starry Sea line planned for next year
shot into the top three trends)

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.839
I saw the comments too.

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:05.600
You're getting roasted.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.820
(426 comments)

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.800
If you can't say anything useful,
just keep quiet.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:14.279
Ms. Gu.

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.079
Be honest with me.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.399
Are you hitting menopause?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.879
Menopause, huh?

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.319
I mean...

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:32.600
The outfit you're wearing today

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.399
makes you look just a little older.

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:36.960
Older, huh?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.200
Why did you hit me?

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.519
Lu Xingchen, listen up.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.159
This side is your work area.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.519
That side is not.

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:44.039
From now on,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.440
you can't cross that line in the middle
during work hours.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.159
And another thing,

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:49.759
stop making
random comments about my clothes.

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.759
You're hilarious.

00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:01.039
A woman actually left you half-dead.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.519
She was a beast.

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:08.759
Three smacks and my head is swollen.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:11.639
I don't get it.

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:13.679
There are so many companies out there.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.559
Why'd you agree to work
for your stepmom's bestie?

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:19.519
The point is,

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:22.559
even after getting beaten up,
you still won't quit.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:26.279
Either you're a masochist,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.120
or you're doing it out of spite

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:29.200
for your dad.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.320
You've been reading way too many novels.

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.519
I'm done talking.

00:09:34.577 --> 00:09:35.600
I'll check on the horse.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.039
Shark!

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.159
(Is this really GL's new season?)

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:50.519
(GL thinks they can
fool people with this trash?)

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:51.919
(Even my mom wouldn't wear it.)

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:52.720
(Exactly.)

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.810
(And they call this the hottest design
for young people?)

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.240
(It's not the Qing dynasty anymore.)

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.200
(Do they not care
what we actually like anymore?)

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.039
(Customers are supposed to be king.)

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.080
You're here.

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:20.360
I came to pick up my meds.

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:24.000
How have you been lately?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.360
Back on medication again.

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.440
The nightmares are getting worse too.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.840
Is it because

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.960
Starry Sea got leaked early?

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:32.320
And the pressure is on you?

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.039
So you've seen the news too.

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:38.919
Feels like life's just
one tangled mess right now.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.519
Don't try to shoulder everything
on your own.

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.799
That only makes your condition flare up.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.799
I just want to do as much as I can.

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:51.799
So what do you want to do?

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.639
At the very least,

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.279
I need to see Starry Sea through.

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:00.000
Take a breath.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.080
Think through the first step.

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:04.000
If you feel unstable,

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.533
remember deep breathing
and mindfulness meditation.

00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:12.120
But I still hope

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:14.200
you'll cut out
those outside stressors too.

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:24.519
Thanks, Dr. Yu.

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:34.799
(GL released
an official statement yesterday.)

00:11:34.879 --> 00:11:37.840
(Starry Sea was confirmed as
the work of Graceful Line's designer.)

00:11:37.866 --> 00:11:39.400
(Because the style is so different)

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.759
(from her previous works,
it stirred up heated debate online.)

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:42.360
(Today,)

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:44.399
(we've invited Graceful Line's founder,)

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:45.120
(Ms. Gu Liusu,)

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.639
(to answer netizens' questions.)

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:48.720
(Hello, I'm Gu Liusu.)

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.399
(Everyone's curious
about this mysterious designer.)

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:53.919
(Ms. Gu, why'd this season's
collection turn out like this?)

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:57.080
(The concept isn't
something I want to reveal just yet.)

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.600
(But the early leak lets us hear)

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:02.120
(people's voices more directly.)

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.799
(As for the designer...)

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:05.840
(Sadly, I have to tell you all,)

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.519
she passed away last week.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.279
(To honor her memory)

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.200
(and show the true meaning
behind her work,)

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:16.200
(we're working hard
on refining the collection.)

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.440
Impossible.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.754
Thank you, everyone.

00:12:19.755 --> 00:12:22.080
And thanks to Ms. Gu
for joining our live radio broadcast.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.200
- This has been Express Radio...
- No way!

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:27.080
(I hope that
with everyone's encouragement,)

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.840
(our company can deliver
a good result.)

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.759
Why are you here?

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:33.600
Mr. Xingchen.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.666
Your emergency contact number
in China is my phone.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.200
Someone called me this morning.

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:38.799
They said you used
Shi Yue's Weibo

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.639
(Shi Yue: What did you post?)
to make a post looking for a designer.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.519
The picture you used now
has copyright issues.

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:43.320
You're being sued.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.977
(What did you post on my account?)

00:12:46.311 --> 00:12:48.400
(What's going on?)

00:12:48.444 --> 00:12:49.420
(Shi Yue: GL dragged me to their office,
saying they need evidence.)

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:50.679
Mr. Xingchen,

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:52.200
can you explain the whole story to me,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.000
so I know how to help you fix this?

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:55.440
We're going to GL.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.120
I really don't know anything, Officers.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.360
I'm innocent.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.000
Officers.

00:13:08.044 --> 00:13:09.080
Here are all the records

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.044
of our design drafts
from the first sketch to now,

00:13:11.044 --> 00:13:12.155
and the patent applications.

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:13.869
It really wasn't me.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.244
It's a misunderstanding, Officers.

00:13:15.266 --> 00:13:17.480
Why would I waste time
stealing someone else's secrets?

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:18.720
Come on, just confess.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.799
Who put you up to this?

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.679
Confess to what?

00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:24.480
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.159
Fine.

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:26.600
Still playing dumb, huh?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.109
Since you're so loyal to your master,

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.880
you can deal
with the consequences yourself.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.519
Officer.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.799
It was his Weibo post.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:33.559
Look.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.759
It's even verified.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.039
Gu Liusu!

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.240
Lu Xingchen.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.519
What exactly did you post?

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:41.039
Xiaolu.

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:41.480
Quiet.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.999
- Is it true the designer's dead?
- Yes.

00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:45.360
So you did post it?

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:47.919
Good, you're here.

00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:49.039
Explain yourself.

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:56.919
How could this happen?

00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:01.120
Isn't he the new secretary?

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.240
How'd he stir up such a mess?

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.919
Wait till Ms. Gu gets here
and see how it's handled.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.150
They say your dad is
landing a big project.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.799
Hand over some more cash.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.150
Didn't I give you money last time?

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.279
How dare you talk back?

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:15.149
Stop right there!

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.570
Try saying that outside, I dare you!

00:14:16.577 --> 00:14:17.790
Picking on kids, huh?

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.420
