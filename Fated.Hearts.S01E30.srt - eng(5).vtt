Your Highness, where are you going?

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.080
There is no place

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.280
for me in this palace.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.729
Of course I must leave.

I heard

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.000
you actually defied

it was me.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.680
How outrageous!

I ordered you

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.430
to watch Princess Xiyang

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.150

Don't you have a mouth?

Why didn't you speak up for yourself?

Every time I come,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.110
you either claim you're busy

has become my enemy.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.080
The prince I trusted most

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.410
deceived me so cruelly.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.000
I… I don't know

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.480
what meaning my life still has.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.960
I risked everything to save you,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.290
and you just want to die?

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.720
If you value your life so little,

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.720
why did I save you in the first place?

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.120
Listen to me.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.600
Nothing is

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.720
more important than staying alive.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720
Even if it's for my sake,

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.870
you must live well!

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.120
But if only I had found out sooner

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.240
what they were really like,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.570
I could have warned you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.720
You wouldn't have

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.980
almost lost your life.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.200
I'm just a fool.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.910
What right do I have

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:49.910
to be your brother?

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.320
I don't deserve to be your brother.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.450
Just leave me alone.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:53.670
Just leave me alone.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.320
Ning Fei.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.790
It's not that serious.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.190
No matter what you think,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.200
you'll always be my brother.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.600
What?

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.440
Don't you want to grow old

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.370
with me anymore?

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:09.720
Don't you want

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.910
to live a carefree life with me

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.570
in a beautiful place anymore?

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.030
Ning Fei,

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.030
you were the fearless,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.440
battle‑hardened,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.100
number one general of Jinxiu.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.910
I've always known

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.320
that nothing

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.520
could ever break you.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.020
Listen carefully.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.030
From today on,

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.650
you must pull yourself together.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.280
That's more like it.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.440
That's my brother.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.870
That's the Ning Fei I know.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:53.360
Sister.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.210
Feng Suige is awake.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.510
Feng Suige!

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.510
Feng Suige, you're awake.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.200
Thank goodness.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.740
You're finally awake.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.030
Yixiao.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.030
I'm awake.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.750
I'm fine now, Yixiao.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.060
That's wonderful.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.810
You're finally awake.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.240
They told me everything.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.440
You went all out to save me.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.160
Thank you for everything you did for me.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.310
It's nothing.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.090
How are you feeling?

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:39.960
Good.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.630
I'm fine now.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.050
What's wrong with you?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.600
Look at me.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.440
Are you...

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.840
are you feeling unwell?

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.600
I can't see you now.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.450
What's happening?

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.380
It's alright, Yixiao.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.480
What's going on?

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:29.870
You can't see me?

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.000
What's going on here?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.240
Yixiao,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:35.790
don't panic.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.320
I was planning

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.360
to tell you later.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.680
After he woke up,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.030
he became blind.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.500
He went without air too long.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.030
Blood clotted in his head

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.290
and hasn't dispersed.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.850
To be honest,

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.870
although his life was saved,

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.870
his eyes

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.870
may never recover.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.930
It's okay, Yixiao.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:57.920
It's alright.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.790
You've done your best

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:00.750
to save my life.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.980
This is already the best outcome.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.270
I'm already very content and happy.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.500
It's okay, Yixiao.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.200
Yixiao.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.040
Don't talk like that.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.200
Since Heaven

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.130
let you survive,

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.030
you're meant to take back

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.480
everything you've lost.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.480
You'll be fine.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.030
I'll be fine.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.360
I'll recover, Yixiao.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.470
Are you...

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.030
Are you crying?

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.480
Don't cry, Yixiao.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.720
I'll gradually get used to it.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.910
I'll get better.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.200
What matters most right now

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.440
is that you're here with me.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.300
That's enough.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.630
I don't want you to get used to it.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.830
I want you to recover.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.910
I know you two

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:41.960
have already

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.290
done so much to save him.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.240
But Feng Suige

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.080
really cannot lose his eyesight.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.870
He's already lost too much.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.520
He still has many things to do.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.550
I beg you,

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.870
please find a way to help him.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.750
Please find a way to heal his eyes.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.800
Miss Yixiao, may I have a word with you?

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.570
I'll be right back.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.080
All right.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.440
I haven't avenged Father yet.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.080
Xiyang is still trapped
in enemy territory.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.740
But now I've become like this.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.590
I can't be a burden to Yixiao any longer.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.110
Some things are hard to say

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.370
in front of Feng Suige.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.120
The blood clot in his head is still there.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.840
If it hardens

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.360
and blocks his meridians,

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.160
even the gods couldn't save him.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.150
In other words,

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.960
even though he's awake,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.870
his life is

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.800
still in danger.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.200
As physicians, we can only do our best.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.400
We cannot fight fate.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.160
This is not his fate.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.550
Feng Suige's fate

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.410
is to live a long and healthy life.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.020
Elder Zhou,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:00.840
Lord Ling,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.750
you're both renowned physicians.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.870
There must still be a way.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:04.960
There must still be a way

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.020
to save him, right?

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.070
I beg you both,

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:07.920
think harder.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.240
You can surely think of a way

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.030
to heal him.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.290
I'm begging you.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.080
Please save him.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:13.750
Lord Ling.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.870
Actually…

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.650
there might be a way.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.270
Don't come up with reckless ideas.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.730
Let's ask Lady An for help.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.600
No!

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.120
Absolutely not! Definitely not!

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.840
Why not?

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.790
I can set aside our personal grudges

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.870
for now,

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.390
but for Suige's sake,
I can't take the risk.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.630
Both of us have run out of options.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:36.970
Why not turn to Lady An?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.930
Turn to her? How?

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.910
Even if she agrees to help,

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:40.960
can you guarantee she'll save him

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.390
and not harm him?

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.120
I guarantee!

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.270
Lord Ling,

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.720
do you actually

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720
have another way,

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.320
but just don't want to use it?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.150
N-No, I don't.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:49.960
That's not it.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.420
Then why won't you tell me?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.890
Look at that man.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.140
He's called Huang.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.670
He once fell off a cliff

00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.910
while hunting

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.000
and hit his head. He nearly died.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.440
Even Zhou Hao couldn't save him.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.600
Then Lady An stepped in.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.660
She saved his life,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.360
but he lost

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.480
all his memories.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.370
Could we at least ask her

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.000
to check on Suige first?

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.320
If this is our only option,

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.440
we have to at least try.

If I have to forget you,

I cannot accept it.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.220
And what about you?

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:40.990
♪ Clouds vanish, rain ceases, seek me ♪

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.580
Your Highness.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.550
How are things going?

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.830
I've gained Wang Encheng's trust.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.360
He's agreed to work with us.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.240
Tonight, just as you planned,

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.110
he'll host a banquet for his colleagues

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.750
at Bowu Restaurant in Shengjing.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.720
The invited guests

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.440
are all from the list

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.240
you provided.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.890
Have you booked a private room?

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.000
Yes.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.160
This is the map of the imperial palace.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.730
I've marked a few spots.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.170
Memorize them.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.520
What's this for?

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.100
When we move against Xia Jingyan,

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:23.920
we must prepare

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.650
an escape route for ourselves.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.680
Those locations

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.800
are guarded by our own people

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.140
and can be used when we escape.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.920
After you memorize them,

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.110
destroy it.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.510
Don't leave

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.370
any loose ends.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.690
Understood.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.080
I'll burn it right away.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.010
And this Daily Chronicle—

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.080
I've memorized it well.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.170
Burn this, too.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.800
Understood.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.720
[Wang Encheng, Minister of Revenue]

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.880
The Empress Dowager promoted me
to Minister of Revenue.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.650
It should have brought great honor

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.030
to my entire family.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.360
But outsiders don't know

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:19.960
that this position

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.110
was obtained at the cost

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.110
of my wife's honor.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.200
My wife,

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.780
after being summoned by His Majesty,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.760
drowned herself the very next day!

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:32.450
His Majesty

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.310
just rewarded me with a dancer

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.400
as a concubine,

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.890
calling her compensation for me!

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.640
My youngest son just turned
one month old days ago,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.700
yet I didn't dare hold a celebration.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.160
I'm afraid people would

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.420
gossip behind my back,

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.520
saying my son doesn't look like me.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.960
My family has been loyal for generations,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.020
yet we've been humiliated like this!

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.490
The Emperor is a tyrant!

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.400
Are you all

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.130
going to keep tolerating this?

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.240
What choice do we have?

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.770
He is the sovereign;

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:02.960
we are his subjects!

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.030
How I hate it!

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.850
The Emperor has no virtue or morality.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.920
Why do we have to

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.380
suffer such humiliation?

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.250
What sin have we committed

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.110
to deserve this?

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.840
When patience runs out,

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.120
it's time to stop enduring!

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.720
So you all hate His Majesty

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.880
so much.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.210
Gentlemen,

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.400
I have recorded

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.200
[Wang Encheng: When patience runs out,
it's time to stop enduring!]

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200
every single word

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.520
you just said.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.780
Speaking ill of His Majesty
is punishable by death.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.270
You arranged this banquet.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.160
You knew
the Prince of Zhennan was outside

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.920
and deliberately made us
speak out of turn!

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.640
It was you!

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.160
You set us up!

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.680
The Emperor is corrupt and lecherous.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.750
He defiles officials' wives.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.750
He's unworthy to rule this kingdom!

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.510
The Prince of Zhennan is
the late emperor's eldest son.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.550
If not for the Empress Dowager
seizing power

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.920
after the late emperor's death,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.640
how could that talentless

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.440
and immoral Xia Jingyan
have ascended the throne?

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.060
Are you still going to endure?

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.350
I can't take it anymore.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.440
You're forcing us into ruin!

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.030
If this booklet is presented
to His Majesty,

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.640
you'll all be doomed as well.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.940
Prince of Zhennan,

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.960
I have no grudge against you.

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.710
Why are you trying to harm me?

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.750
You are wrong.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.950
The Prince of Zhennan isn't harming us.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.640
He's here to save us.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.650
He can deliver us from this misery.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.610
Fellow colleagues,

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.330
this opportunity comes only once.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.790
If we lose it,

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.480
we'll be doomed forever.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.030
But the Prince of Zhennan
can barely protect himself,

00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:59.240
let alone save us.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.080
As long as I still breathe

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.970
and the fire of vengeance burns within me,

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.820
hope can be born from despair.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.270
The humiliation you've suffered

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.870
is nothing compared to mine.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.790
We share the same fate—

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.370
all the more reason to band together.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:18.680
Don't you agree?

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.440
You're all

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.720
pillars of Jinxiu.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.160
But because of that tyrant,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.160
you've been forced to endure in silence.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.640
From today on,

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.750
your revenge

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.030
is my revenge.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.440
I will

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.400
take revenge for you.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.310
I only need all of you

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.360
to help me with one thing.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.130
Don't worry.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.520
What I want is just a small favor

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.550
from all of you.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.750
I'm at your service, Your Highness.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.240
Your Highness, please tell us

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.120
what you want us to do.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.310
Your Majesty,

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.960
Princess Xiyang

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.690
still refuses to eat anything.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.160
Are you planning
to starve yourself to death?

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.200
Have you found

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.060
who killed my father and brother?

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.160
If she won't eat,

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.550
can't you feed her?

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.940
I'm asking you! Did you find the culprit?

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:07.200
If you still refuse to eat,

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.200
I will kill her.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.720
No, please, Your Majesty!

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.240
Please.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.000
Go.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.240
Bring more food.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.200
Yes.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.000
Get up!

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:25.440
Spit it out! Now!

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.340
Spit it out!

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.210
Spit it out!

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.600
Feng Xiyang, are you crazy?

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.300
Spit it out!

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.160
Well?

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.510
Can you tell me now?

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:43.310
Get out!

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.440
Did I ever promise you

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.920
that I'd tell you?

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.480
So you did find them.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.750
You have nothing now.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.200
What do you have to trade with me?

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.150
Do you want me to tell you?

What is it like

to lose all your memories?

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.960
To wake up with no memory at all,

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.440
not remembering your life,

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.490

or anyone

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:52.310
you once loved.

Yixiao.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.790
Yixiao?

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.440
It's me.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.770
I know you have no appetite.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.510
But Lord Ling said

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.610
you haven't eaten for a long time.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.160
You just woke up and are still very weak.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.710
