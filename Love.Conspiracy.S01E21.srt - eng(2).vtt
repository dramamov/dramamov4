[Episode 21]

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.340
Back then,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.620
Qian Guanshu took
the Ji family's rough gemstones

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.900
and framed my family for it.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.980
Now, Ye Taiting is trying to use me

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.060
to secure the Drizzt project.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.700
All these years,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.100
that old fossil
surely knows how to strategize.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.940
Just you wait.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.140
The real show has just begun.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.420
Mr. Ye.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.140
Ms. Song is here.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.300
Zhizhi,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.540
what brings you here today?

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.140
Mr. Ye,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.500
I got some great tea recently

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.500
and wanted to share it with you.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.540
Oh, you kid.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.140
You're too kind.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.500
Our collaboration

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.100
has been very pleasant this time.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.860
And it's really thanks to you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.300
that I could form a new team.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.220
We're family.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.860
Collaboration is only natural.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.900
Besides,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.260
the excellent plans we got from you

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.740
have been a great help.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.340
It seems

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.660
he still hasn't realized
that the plan was fake.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.740
Mr. Ye.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.140
Actually, I came here

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.980
to discuss something

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.460
more important with you

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.580
Go on.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.540
I recently

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.220
got connected with some higher-ups
at Drizzt.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.620
I heard

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.660
that for this agency selection,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.220
Drizzt isn't just looking
for strong financial backing,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.020
but also for absolute authority
and influence

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.220
in the jewelry industry.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.260
So I was thinking,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.180
if we bid

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.340
under the name

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.420
of Starlight Jewelry this time,

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.420
would our chances be better?

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.740
I agree to

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.980

I've prepared a contract for you.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.140
Please, take a look.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.940
Working with you,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.220
I must show absolute sincerity.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.860
I'm offering you four

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.300

in tier-one cities.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.460
I'll use all
of Starlight Jewelry's remaining assets

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.380
as leverage,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.700

secure the agency rights for Drizzt.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.700
I must say,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.340
I'm seriously impressed.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.140

A few shareholders
came to see me earlier.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.980
They're still concerned

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.700
about your excessive investment

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.500
in the Drizzt project.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.900
You need to weigh the pros and cons
carefully yourself.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.500
I understand.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.940
I'll weigh them properly.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.940
I must secure this project.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.420
But after it's done, I have one request.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.860
A request?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.980
Speak.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.300
Return all the designers we poached

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.500
from Starlight Jewelry.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.700
What?

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.820
Impossible.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.820
When we founded Zhifu Jewelry,

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.780
we hired them with high salaries.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.940
And they signed non-compete agreements.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.780
They can't leave.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.060
Not a single one.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.300
If that's the case,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.340
then I'll give her
the entire Zhifu Jewelry.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.500
You...

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.460

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.860
listen to yourself!

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.100
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.620
I thought your sole focus on the bid

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.260
was to take down Ye Taiting.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.860
I was even thinking

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.340
about how to persuade
the other shareholders.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.260
And here you are,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.740
still hung up
on these romantic sentiments!

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.020
I'm bidding for Drizzt

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.340
precisely to defeat Ye Taiting!

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.420
That design team

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.180
belonged to Starlight Jewelry!

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.980
We know well

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.060
the rough gemstones incident
had nothing to do with Song Shan.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.260
But you insisted on poaching their team

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.500
and ruining their company.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.660
Now Song Zhizhi is helpless!

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.540
Shouldn't I help her?

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.020
You need to help yourself
remember your place!

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.140
You are a businessman!

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.300
Business is business.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.460
The business world
is a battlefield, kid!

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.940
Get a grip.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.300
Anyway,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.460
we wronged Song Zhizhi

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.420
and the Song family!

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.820
I understand everything

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.460
you did for Mom.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.180
But we can't hurt other people

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.660
because of it!

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.020
Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.980
I know.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.740
I love Song Zhizhi.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.100
Just like you loved Mom.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.980
There's a board meeting tomorrow.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.140
Making the Drizzt project work

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.900
depends on your skills.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.940
And,

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.980
even if we win the bid,

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.900
the ownership of Zhifu

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.220
isn't mine to decide alone.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.740
Baijian,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.100
I've trained you all these years,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.940
hoping to make you

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.220
an excellent

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.620
and rational businessman.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.820
Hello?

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.260
This is Nie Wenzhi.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.460
Nie Wenzhi?

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.460
What do you want?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.740
I need to see you.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.580
There's something I want to give you.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.700
I think it could help you

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.780
in dealing with Ye Taiting.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.500
Where are you now?

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.060
I'll send you my location.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:11.660
I'll be waiting.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.180
Why did you ask to meet here?

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.380
Don't be afraid.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.140
Things have gone too far now.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.540
I won't do anything else to hurt you.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.020
Come in.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.260
Have a seat.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.500
This is for you.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.300
Why are you giving this to me?

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.860
Qian Guanshu gave it to me.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.060
Qian Guanshu?

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.580
Why would he give you a watch?

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.500
Qian Guanshu was my husband.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.340
He was your husband?

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.860
Then

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.460
why did you marry my dad?

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.300
Because we were desperately poor.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.900
Especially after I gave birth to Wenhan,

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.580
we could barely make ends meet.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.420
One day, Qian told me

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.740
the Song family was really wealthy,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.260
and the man of the house
was still single.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.580
If I could marry into the Song family,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.500
I could get into high society,

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.940
have plenty of money,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.060
and secure a happy life for my son.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.420
So, for money,

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.380
and for his own selfish desires,

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.060
Qian Guanshu just handed you
and his son over to someone else?

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.740
You could say that.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.380
But later, after Qian Guanshu reported
to the police at Starlight Group

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.700
and had Wenhan arrested.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.500
I've completely given up on him.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.220
He only ever cares about himself.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.180
He never considered us family.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.260
Qian Guanshu has done
so many evil things.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.420
Why didn't you speak up sooner

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.260
and let him face the consequences?

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.740
You're oversimplifying things.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.540
I know Qian Guanshu very well.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.260
He's meticulous in everything he does.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.420
He won't give me
any chance to catch him out.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.740
Then why are you reaching out to me now?

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.500
He's utterly ruthless
when it comes to his own interests.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.860
He even sacrificed his own son.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.260
I have to make him pay.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.700
If I keep helping him hide the truth,
I'd be failing Wenhan.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.340
Back when he gave me this watch,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.020
he insisted I mustn't let anyone
discover it.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.460
I was very puzzled.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.780
It was the first time
I saw such a sinister look

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.700
in Qian Guanshu's eyes.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.780
Even now, the memory
sends a chill down my spine.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.580
My gut tells me

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.300
this watch

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.100
hides a huge secret.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.620
And it's definitely

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.100
nothing good.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.100
I hope you can defeat Qian Guanshu

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.900
and make him face the punishment
he deserves.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.180
Qian Guanshu has been
with Ye Taiting all these years.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.860
He must have done plenty of evil deeds.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.980
There must be

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.420
a huge secret behind this watch.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.940
I'll look into this watch.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.220
With this brand,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.100
we should be able to trace the owner
through the serial number.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.060
I'll do my best.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.660
I'll wait for your good news.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.220

In this proposal,

we've incorporated the highlights

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.100

the agency rights for Drizzt

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.460
is as good as ours!

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.540
Mr. Ye,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.140
now that you've reviewed it,
I'll be taking this back.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.580
What are you doing?

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.100
I hope you honor our agreement

Zhizhi,

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.940
I just admire

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.740
that killer instinct in you.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.460
Mr. Ye, don't worry.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.140
I'll give it my all.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.540
If there's nothing else,

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.900
I won't disturb you.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.220
Alright.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.140
Ms. Song, is there something else?

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.460
Mr. Qian,

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.700
you've lived so cautiously
all these years.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.060
It must be exhausting.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.540
Ms. Song, what are you implying?

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.020
Nothing.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.140
Just making an observation.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.700
You and Mr. Ye are quite alike.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.620
You're both so meticulous,

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.740
always thinking several steps ahead.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:25.740
Not at all.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.220
Just doing what I should.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.580
That girl is difficult to deal with.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.260
So aggressive.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.060
Mr. Ye, congratulations
on your double happiness.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.180
Not double.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.220
It's triple.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.580
Triple?

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.140
A few days ago,

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.100
I was reunited

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.380
with my son.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.820
Son?

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.420
Mr. Ye.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.020
Mr. Ye, since when do you have a son?

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.420
I've been working on confirming this

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.980
for a while.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.580
It's been such a long time, after all.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.620
We should avoid any mistakes.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.780
It's

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.020
finally confirmed now.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.700
So now, I just want my son back

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.460
by my side soon

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.060
and get familiar
with all the group's operations.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.620
I'll introduce him to all my contacts
and resources.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.300
Once the group goes public,

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.540
I'll let him

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.860
take the helm.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.980
Then I'll retire.
Step back from the front lines.

Just enjoy my retirement.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.620
aren't you going to ask me

if you were willing to tell me,

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.260
you wouldn't need me to ask.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.060
I'll tell you.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.620
His name is

Yes. He's my son!

Ziming is great.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.620
A fine young man.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:49.940
Very capable.

I can call the police

Ye Taiting ordered you to do it.

was over a decade ago.

I doubt you'll be able to
reopen the case.

But I have some information

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.780
I actually dug up a secret.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.180
Guess who owns that nursing home?

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:39.900
Who?

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.180
Ye Taiting.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.020
And

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.300
according to a nurse there,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.860
Ye Taiting never once visited

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.740
Wei Ziming's mother,

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.940
but he kept asking
about her son's whereabouts.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.740
Recently, Ms. Wang's mental state

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.860
had actually improved a bit.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.060
She said some things about her son.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.900
Ye Taiting was thrilled.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.220
Then

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.260
three days later,

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.180
Ms. Wang died in an accident.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.380
Died in an accident?

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.540
According to that nurse,

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.100
Ms. Wang was determined
to send her son away.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.940
Said something about not letting him
grow up near a murderer.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.900
A murderer?

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.940
This is Ms. Wang's belongings.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.820
I had someone get them out immediately.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.540
Take a look.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.340
How old was he
when he was sent to the orphanage?

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.180
Eight, I think.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.140
Eight years old?

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.860
He was eight, and I was seven.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.380
The year my parents
died in the car crash.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.380
Qian Guanshu,

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.500
Ji Baijian is already looking into

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.060
the nursing home
where Ziming's mother was!

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.540
Did you know about this?

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.380
I didn't expect Ji Baijian
to find it so quickly.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.580
After I had her dealt with,

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.380
I handled the aftermath swiftly.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.740
I even replaced all the medical staff

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.660
who had contact with her.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.420
It's just...

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.420
Just what?

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.580
There was one young nurse
I didn't get to in time.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.820
Qian Guanshu,

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.220
you always mess up

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.020
and leave me to clean up your mess!

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:46.660
Mr. Ye,

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:47.940
I transferred

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.420
that nurse to another city.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.660
There's no way Ji Baijian can find her.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.020
But she

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.940
already gave the woman's belongings

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.540
to Ji Baijian!

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.140
I checked all her belongings.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.180
Got rid of what I had to.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.180
There were just some old drawings.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.180
I've taken care of them all.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.420
Don't worry.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.540
Are you sure?

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.140
I'm sure.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.340
Ziming,

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.980
what brings you here?

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.500
You must be tired lately

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:48.940
with all the company work.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.620
It has been exhausting.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.660
You know

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.220
the company isn't what it used to be.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.060
So there's a lot to handle.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.180
But for Starlight Jewelry,

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:01.940
I have no complaints.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:08.900
It's alright.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.220
Everything will be better soon.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.100
Soon, I'll be able to
help the Song family

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.300
and you.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.540
Once I have a higher status,

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.260
everyone will see me in a new light.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.980
Ziming,

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.060
what do you mean by that?

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:37.900
You'll know soon enough.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.380
I won't allow Ji Baijian to deceive

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.820
and hurt you again.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.740
I'll protect the Song family

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.260
and you.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.140
What happened between Ji Baijian and me

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:55.940
is in the past.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.020
I don't want this to affect you.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.380
I'll handle

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:01.860
my relationship issues.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.980
You've forgiven him?

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.620
Have you forgotten what he did to you?

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.460
I haven't.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.700
I just

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.740
don't want revenge anymore.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.140
For me and him,

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.780
only when we don't contact each other
do we have a chance...

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.380
Ziming,

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.820
don't worry about my issues.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.940
But you seem weird today.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.500
Is something wrong?

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.500
What did you mean

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.340
about a "higher status"?

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.540
Zhizhi,

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.380
if I had a higher status,

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.220
would you

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.380
still see me as a brother?

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.420
Of course.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.620
You'll always be my brother.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.580
I see.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.580
I should go.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.500
See you tomorrow.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.380
See you tomorrow.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.660
Guanshu,

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.580
everyone is speculating

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.100
about which side Song Zhizhi is on.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.020
What's your take?

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.380
To be honest, Mr. Ye,

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.580
I'm worried that Song Zhizhi
might betray us at the last minute

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.340
and abandon the bid

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.020
to ensure Zhifu Jewelry wins.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.020
But...

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.740
But we've already

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.820
agreed to having Starlight Jewelry

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.460
represent the group in the bid.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.380
It's a bit of a problem.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.660
Normally,

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.380
Song Zhizhi wouldn't

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.620
take her father's life's work as a joke.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.620
But it's hard to say.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.220
She holds shares in Zhifu Jewelry too.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.660
And her relationship with Ji Baijian...

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.340
Guanshu,

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.340
keep your eyes open.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.820
Actually, we just need to

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.340
ensure Song Zhizhi

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.420
isn't the presenter

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.740
during the bid.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.620
And I've already

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.380
found the perfect person for the role.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:38.620
Who is it?

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:47.620
Mr. Ye,

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:48.940
you wanted to see me?

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.100
Guanshu,

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.940

for this than him?

Starlight Group's bid presenter
has been changed.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.500
I saw.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.300
Wei Ziming must have switched sides.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.380
This is very bad for Zhizhi.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.580
What should we do next?

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.340
Come on.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.300

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.580
make sure you prepare
the bid presentation well.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.380
We all have great confidence in you.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.620
Don't feel pressured.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:50.700
I won't.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:57.900
Mr. Ye,

00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.740
what do you mean?

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.900
Why was I replaced as the bid presenter

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.020
by Wei Ziming?

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.700
Ziming,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.860
you two planned this, didn't you?

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.380
Zhizhi,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.420
you're both from Starlight Jewelry.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.460
Does it make any difference

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.780
which one of you presents?

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.300
Of course it does!

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.780
Though Starlight Jewelry

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.700
is a subsidiary of Starlight Group,

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:24.660
it operates

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.020
relatively independently.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.380
And, I am the major shareholder

While Wei Ziming

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.180
is only the Deputy General Manager.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.580
You changed the presenter

Mr. Ye,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.340
aren't you overstepping?

Zhizhi,

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:42.860
Mr. Ye

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.980
was concerned your position

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:45.820
might make things awkward,

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.060
so he asked me
to present instead...

since when do you
take orders from Mr. Ye?

That's because

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.740
Ye Taiting

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.140
is Wei Ziming's father!

What is going on here?

revealed Ziming's identity today,

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.620
My biological son.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:31.740
Baijian,

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.100
barging into our group office

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.140
and disrupting our meeting like this

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.380
is highly improper.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.540
Was it just to

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:40.900
tell us this?

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.260
I'm here to warn Zhizhi to be careful
of the people around her.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.780
When we talk
about the people around her,

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.020
you, the one set to marry her,

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.260
are that person.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.460
You should be more concerned

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.500
about who the people
around you really are.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.660
What do you mean by that?

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.820
You don't know what I mean?

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.380
Then I'll be blunt.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.180
You are not Ji Baijian!
