Mr. Xingchen,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.959
today I'll give you your first lesson

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:06.439
on the basics
of corporate business management.

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:08.799
I hope you'll pay attention.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.659
For fundamental business theories,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.659
through learning macroeconomics,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.159
you'll learn how fundamental theories
affect business,

00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:18.799
so you can make an economic outlook
in advance when doing strategic planning.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.719
So,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.799
do you know
what an "economic outlook" means?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.258
Why would I need you if I did?

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.400
Carry on.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.138
The project we developed together
with the environmental agency

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:29.939
generated five revenue growth points
last year.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.618
Macroeconomics is about

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.439
understanding how the economy
affects business activity.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.418
Economic management

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:39.159
and the macroeconomic cycle
are both essential.

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:43.240
There's a key point about macroeconomics
in relation to the two.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.079

(What are you doing, Gu Liusu?)

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.939
So, the practical theories
we learned earlier

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.099
are the most important.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.698
I hope you'll study them well.

00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:02.579
Macroeconomics in relation to economic
management and the business cycle...

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.379
Is this what I taught you today?

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.840
Give it back.

Boss.

What's wrong with you?

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.639
Why haven't you replied for days?

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:33.899
I have an idea.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.338
I figured out the design.

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:36.880
I'll tell you when you get back.

Why aren't you answering me?

Where are you?

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.440
Where are you?

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.538
(Hey, why am I laughing?)

rank among the top ten in the city.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.979
Mr. Lu's very pleased that you came.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.280
He asked me to assist you.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.079
(Are you sure Gu Liusu is back
from the trip?)

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.098
(Of course.)

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.079
(My bestie would definitely let me know
as soon as she's back.)

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.440
I'm going to the bathroom first.

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:51.378
You're right, Mr. Lin.

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.739
- I think we're missing someone.
- Missing someone?

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.880
How could she be late
for such an important meeting?

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:01.880
Are you talking about me, Mr. Lin?

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:03.019
I'm sorry.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.200
My flight was late.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.778
This is an important event.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.899
Why are you dressed so scantily?

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.459
Are you saying I'm underdressed

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.299
or that I look good?

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.419
Please button up, Mr. Lin.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.440
Cover your big belly.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.299
Today's meeting

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.899
concerns the city's image.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.139
It doesn't really have anything
to do with fashion, does it?

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.899
Why not

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.399
have our company take charge of it?

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.178
Anyone capable is welcome to compete.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:26.499
It'd be best to transform the scenic spot
into a large commercial complex

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.379
and bring in shopping malls
and luxury hotels.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.939
If we do that, the tourists' impression
on our city culture

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.538
will remain only superficial.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:33.978
We're not saints.

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.298
We need to make money.

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:36.298
We are businesspeople.

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:37.658
I agree with commercialization,

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.738
but it should complement, not dominate.

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:41.000
Ms. Gu,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.200
no wonder you're a businesswoman.

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:52.699
Why pull that long face all day,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.159
like a Persian cat?

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:55.839
That's just my face.

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:05.599
Boring.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.360
Let's go.

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.298
This idea

00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:11.738
is wonderful,

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:13.579
but it's too idealistic.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.499
I understand you value
economic benefits.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.338
But we can't focus
only on short-term gains

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.978
and lose the chance
to build the city's soul, right?

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.978
Culture is something you can't see or touch.

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.338
How can it sustain a project this big?

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.800
Have you really
considered everything, Ms. Gu?

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:32.658
Mr. Lin has a point.

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.778
Yeah. I agree with him.

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.320
Mr. Lin is far-sighted indeed.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.159
Right.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.560
Oh, Mr. Lin.

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.719
I was wondering which Mr. Lin it was.

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:46.819
Turns out it's that Mr. Lin

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.560
who hired trolls to bash GL.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.519
Who are you?

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:56.858
Let me introduce you.

00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:58.059
Mr. Lu,

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.019
representing Xinghan Group
at this meeting.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.440
I'm just Mr. Lu Junior.

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:06.519
Mr. Lin Xiang,

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.619
I wonder

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.320
if you're unhappy
with Ms. Gu's proposal,

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.418
or if Xinyi Jewelry

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.279
and GL

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.360
have some irreconcilable conflict?

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:20.538
Ms. Gu runs a fashion brand,

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.880
and I own a time-honored gold brand.

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.719
We're in different lines of business.
Why would there be any grudges?

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:29.240
That sounds nice.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.259
But I have a contract

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.699
Mr. Lin Xiang signed

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.098
with a marketing account.

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:35.059
It concerns

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.039
how to smear a rising brand,

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:38.560
GL.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.880
Would you like

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.760
to take a look together?

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:45.418
Young lad,

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.218
I won't argue with you for being rude.

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.320
But you're talking nonsense.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.159
You!

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:53.519
How would Xinyi Jewelry stoop
to such lowly tricks?

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:55.880
Lowly tricks?

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.920
Fine.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.959
Mr. Lin,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.858
you may pay them

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:02.899
to keep their mouths shut.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.120
But if I pay them a little more,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.719
do you think
they'd still keep your secret?

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.120
Mr. Lin.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.000
The media is outside.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.680
If I swing this door open,

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.000
whether Xinyi Jewelry
starts trending online or not,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.079
I can't say.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.800
Mr. Mo,

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.920
is Xinghan really left in the hands

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.880
of this wet-behind-the-ears kid?

00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:44.279
Mr. Lin,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.760
since Mr. Xingchen
is representing Xinghan at this meeting,

00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:49.760
he has the right...

00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:53.699
I'm representing Xinghan.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.200
Nor am I back at Xinghan.

00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:57.990
I just can't sit by
and watch it go to waste.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.218
Our city has a unique history and culture.

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:03.880
If we build on that and integrate it
with cultural tourism,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.479
we can attract tourists
with stronger spending power.

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:09.279
But look at you.

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:12.079
You form cliques for your own interests

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:14.079
and cast the city's development aside.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.320
Very well said.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.399
I have to go.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.459
I have another meeting.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.579
I'll leave you to it.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.560
Ms. Gu,

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.858
if you ever need help,

00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:26.519
just let us know.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.079
See you, Mr. Lin.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.440
Take care, Mr. Lin.

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:52.219
I was puzzled

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.019
how a post from Shi Yue's Weibo account
with fewer than 2,000 followers

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.058
could cause a stir.

00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:00.640
It proves I was being used.

00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:10.418
It really was Xinyi behind it.

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:12.040
How could I not have seen it?

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.920
How did you get this?

00:09:20.659 --> 00:09:21.800
The power of money.

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:32.920
I helped you.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.178
You don't thank me,

00:09:34.179 --> 00:09:35.599
and now you're taking my thing.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.499
You should thank yourself.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.400
You cleared yourself of the suspicion
of being involved with Xinyi.

00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:07.959
Why pull me?

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:26.119
You haven't checked my assignment yet,
Gu Liusu.

00:10:28.699 --> 00:10:29.800
Here's your drink.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.739
That old man Lin Xiang

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.698
must've gone crazy trying to buy GL.

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:37.320
He actually came up
with such a filthy scheme.

00:10:37.819 --> 00:10:40.219
Lu Xingchen must've spent a lot

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.920
to get this contract.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.119
Will your husband be okay?

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:46.698
My bestie,

00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:48.538
we're family now.

00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:50.920
Helping you is helping his future aunt.

00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:52.520
Plus,

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:54.640
the whole mess started because of him.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.440
He should be the one to clean it up.

00:10:57.059 --> 00:10:59.200
He told me he wants to go back to GL.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.440
What do you think?

00:11:03.179 --> 00:11:05.938
I checked the assignment I gave him.

00:11:05.939 --> 00:11:07.680
It's not finished,

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:09.920
but he shows potential.

00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:12.160
So you agree to let him back?

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:18.440
Tang Baozhu, what's with that look?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.959
You've used up
one of your three chances.

00:11:25.939 --> 00:11:27.200
Love you.

00:11:27.659 --> 00:11:28.658
Let me be clear.

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:31.259
There's no other position left
except executive secretary.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.160
I'll make sure

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.599
Secretary Lu starts tomorrow.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.879
Good morning, Ms. Gu.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.440
Good morning.

00:12:12.299 --> 00:12:14.139
Gu Liusu, you're out of your mind.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.719
How could you trust
what a young boy said?

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.160
