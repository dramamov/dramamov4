00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.200
Chief.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.759
Hello, Chief Zhou.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm Qin Shan, the intern assigned to you.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.600
I only take small cases.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.440
not big cases.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.320
You have no future with me.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.240
You should date someone else.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.840
No.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:52.600
Why?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.680
Because you've been

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.240
helping the weak?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.960
In this case, it doesn't matter if you don't make contributions.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.080
That's too little.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.000
Boss.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.520
This time, there are too many interviews.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.400
Our police station

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.440
We don't have enough people. We don't have enough.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.479
Not enough.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.920
You eat and play all day.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.840
There must be not enough people.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.760
Search carefully.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.680
To be honest,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.480
The world is in chaos now.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.680
there are many missing women.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.320
A lot.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.960
Even if there's someone, look into it carefully.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.920
Boss.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.760
I've finished the materials last night.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.360
Look.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.560
Sure, so many.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.160
Do you need me to organize them for you?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.480
Sure.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.440
Okay.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.800
In this chaotic world

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.400
Head.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.760
You showed me the young me.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.880
Stop!

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.520
You showed me

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.320
the ambitions and ideals that I still insist on.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.520
When I'm lost,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.840
I can always find hope from you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.640
and the motivation to move forward.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.480
The greatest luck in the world

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.040
is to have a reliable brother

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.560
with a reliable brother.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.520
Why?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.640
Why did you leave first?

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.680
Qin Shan.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.800
Keep it up.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.480
Yes.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.480
Geum Mu.

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.159
The records of the guest room for the past ten years are here.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.720
The people around the victim

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.240
is the devil who stretches his hand to them.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.360
The police won't send one person to you.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.640
If you don't want to die, go catch him yourself.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.040
Qin Shan.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.800
Good job.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.000
I got the evidence you left me.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.320
Don't worry.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.520
I will find him and avenge you.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.680
Zhou Mu.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.920
I know who Jinmu is.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.840
You're back.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.600
Have you taken care of Qin Shan?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.720
What a pity.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.320
He's always the focus of training in the bureau.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.360
Who knew this would happen?

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.520
I'll send more people

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680
to find the murderer as soon as possible.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.880
You still care about Qin Shan?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.280
What are you talking about?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.400
Qin Shan is my police after all.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.680
I care about him, right?

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.400
So you care about someone else's life too.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.800
Just say it.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.080
Don't be weird.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.560
Do you know who the murderer is?

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.080
What are you talking about?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.920
Are you responsible for what you said?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.120
Of course.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.520
Iâ€™ll be responsible for what I said.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.680
I will also be responsible for Qin Shan and Miaomiao.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.040
If you have a clear conscience,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.680
why didn't you investigate the case of the foreign car shop for me?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.800
You know the human trafficking group, right?

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.520
You know

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.480
in the nursing home, right?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.080
No.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.440
What are you talking about?

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.920
Miao...

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.960
human traffickers and foreign car shops.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.200
What's the connection?

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.840
I thought

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.400
you only cared about your position.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.680
I didn't expect you to be a beast in human clothing.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.240
You trampled on others' lives

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.920
for your own selfish desires.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.920
Even a vicious tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.520
You're really a disgrace.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.520
Zhou Mu.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.920
Are you crazy?

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.760
Yes.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.760
I'm crazy today.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.600
Today, for Qin Shan,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.400
for Miaomiao,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.600
for the peace of the society,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.600
for the people.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.400
So Zhou is Jinmu.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.800
Zhou is so stupid.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.120
Not only Miaomiao,

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200
the human trafficking case.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.320
the opium trafficking case,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.560
and Qin Shan.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.760
From what I know about him,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.159
he won't give up.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.760
Mu.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.240
What do you think?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.320
I...

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.520
I want to persuade him to turn himself in.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.760
He even dared to kill Miao.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.760
What else could he be worried about?

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.480
What would you do

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.560
what would you do?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.480
You'll suffer the chaos.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.080
Mu, just do it.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.159
I'll let Gao Ying protect you with you.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.799
Thank you, Uncle Gao.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.200
Do you know what you're doing?

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.320
Today,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.600
to bring my biological father to justice.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.280
Sister Yan.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.240
Zhou Mu.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.480
Now is the truth about Miaomiao.
