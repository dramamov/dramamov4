Win, You're waiting for a long time.

00:00:11.717 --> 00:00:13.199
If something happened to Nut,

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:14.792
someone would have called by now.

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:16.944
You're feeling better now, right?

00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:19.375
You'll probably be able
to get on a plane soon.

00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:21.592

00:00:21.617 --> 00:00:25.018
stop seeing Chai after the competition,

00:00:25.043 --> 00:00:27.164
We should just forget about that.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.136
Give it up.

Damn!

We're going to release a tape!

00:02:26.452 --> 00:02:29.138
Shit, we're releasing a tape.

00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:34.241
Really?

00:02:34.644 --> 00:02:36.259
Let me check it again.

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:38.615
This label contacted us.

00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:50.681
What's going on?

00:03:01.226 --> 00:03:02.226
I think

00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:05.323
I won't be going to England anymore.

00:03:09.297 --> 00:03:10.937
This proves it, doesn't it?

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.983
That music can be a career.

00:03:21.247 --> 00:03:22.501
From this moment,

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.948
I still don't understand

00:03:24.972 --> 00:03:27.555
what exactly has happened to my life.

Hey.

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:45.310
You're that guy.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.103
I'm going to the Alangkarn
concert before going home.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.100
Interested in going?

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:53.632
Let's go.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.447
Do you think

00:03:55.873 --> 00:03:57.673
we should start a band together?

00:03:58.264 --> 00:03:59.320
Join a band.

00:03:59.567 --> 00:04:00.682
Compete.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:01.954
Fight.

00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:03.988
Try to change the future.

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.157
Even though I know
it's probably impossible.

00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:07.724
You can hold my hand like this.

00:04:12.282 --> 00:04:14.403
I don't understand how I got here.

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:16.718
But even so,

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.817
there's one thing I do understand.

If we make the most of
every second we have,

Hey, I'm going home.

You two,

00:05:03.127 --> 00:05:04.529
you don't have a problem, right?

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:06.769
Hey.

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.051
What problem? Nothing.

00:05:10.907 --> 00:05:12.667
If there's anything,
you should clear it up.

00:05:12.948 --> 00:05:14.628
We have to go to the studio in a few days.

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:17.411
I told you there's nothing.

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:20.016
Right, Ek?

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.105
Yes.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.466
You guys can continue packing.

00:05:36.743 --> 00:05:38.168
Do you believe that

00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:40.018
those two don't really have a problem?

00:05:40.795 --> 00:05:42.055
Of course not.

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.095
So what should we do?

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.209
Nothing.

00:05:46.695 --> 00:05:48.357
We can't get too involved in this.

00:05:57.327 --> 00:05:58.413
Trust me.

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:02.922
You're so good about love.

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:07.926
Well, I've gotten a lot
better since I met you.

00:06:10.807 --> 00:06:11.973
Are you crazy?

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.082
Okay, I don't touch.

00:06:22.402 --> 00:06:24.054
So where do you want me to put my hand?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.060
Well,

00:06:27.182 --> 00:06:28.878
put it where you want to put it.

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:46.815
Hey.

00:06:46.942 --> 00:06:48.342
Are you okay?

00:06:50.704 --> 00:06:51.844
Of course.

00:06:53.335 --> 00:06:54.963
Why wouldn't I be okay?

00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:56.838
Liar.

00:06:56.862 --> 00:06:58.605
Do you know that when you lie,

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.437
your nose flares?

00:07:00.665 --> 00:07:01.987
- Hey!
- See? It's flaring again.

00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:03.920
Crazy, that's not true.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.072
Come on, let's go eat.

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:11.078
They say that if you eat,

00:07:11.102 --> 00:07:12.689
- your nose will stop flaring.
- Hey!

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:15.452
You're talking nonsense.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.232
Chai.

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:36.375
Chai.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.133
Lately, you haven't been talking to me,

00:07:41.158 --> 00:07:42.598
haven't been going anywhere with me,

00:07:42.986 --> 00:07:44.466
acting like we don't know each other.

00:07:44.612 --> 00:07:45.986
Do you hate me now?

00:08:03.893 --> 00:08:05.240
Why don't you tell me?

00:08:06.935 --> 00:08:08.796
How many hundred reasons do I need

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:10.550
to hate you?

00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:17.765
Listen, Ek.

00:08:19.915 --> 00:08:21.382
No matter what it takes,

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:24.321
I want to be with you.

00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:26.386
But now,

00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:28.398
give me some time.

00:08:30.034 --> 00:08:32.364
I'm going to make myself better,
to be worthy of you.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.089
So that we can be together.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.941
So if I wait,

00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:42.839
we can be together, right?

00:08:45.865 --> 00:08:47.052
Yeah.

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:50.581
So stop whining already.

00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:52.381
Okay?

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:53.982
Okay.

00:08:55.813 --> 00:08:56.821
I'm going.

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:23.342
Sorry for the wait.

00:09:23.988 --> 00:09:25.318
Thank you.

00:09:25.349 --> 00:09:26.911
Here are your noodles, ladies.

00:09:26.935 --> 00:09:28.007
Thank you.

00:09:28.032 --> 00:09:29.080
Enjoy your meal.

00:09:29.105 --> 00:09:30.234
Thank you.

00:09:32.193 --> 00:09:33.193
Here.

00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:34.835
Thank you.

00:09:50.689 --> 00:09:52.358
Why did you choose this restaurant?

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.233
Because I know you like it.

00:09:56.307 --> 00:09:58.269
I've never told anyone before.

00:09:59.277 --> 00:10:00.640
I could tell from how you always buy it

00:10:00.664 --> 00:10:02.466
to eat at the rehearsal room.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.871
It could just be because it's nearby.

00:10:08.717 --> 00:10:09.802
And also,

00:10:10.202 --> 00:10:11.802
it's not expensive, something like that.

00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:14.248
I could tell from your expression, Lin.

00:10:14.272 --> 00:10:15.449
It's very obvious.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.963
Is it that obvious?

00:10:19.804 --> 00:10:21.647
When you eat something you like, Lin,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.208
you chewing, nom, nom.

00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:25.081
And you make this face. Look.

00:10:28.398 --> 00:10:29.668
Hey.

00:10:29.692 --> 00:10:31.019
That's not true.

00:10:31.232 --> 00:10:33.259
I don't look that ugly.

00:10:33.757 --> 00:10:35.061
Want to see the proof?

00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:36.792
I brought my Polaroid camera.

00:10:38.997 --> 00:10:40.552
I'll take a picture for you right now.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:42.750
No.

00:10:47.231 --> 00:10:48.577
Just a little bit.

00:10:48.602 --> 00:10:51.282
- Come on, I'll take a picture for you.
- With a camera like this...

00:10:51.522 --> 00:10:52.893
how can I eat?

00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:54.386
Come on.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.165
Hey.

00:10:57.259 --> 00:10:58.660
Are you a thief?

00:11:03.594 --> 00:11:04.941
Here.

00:11:06.002 --> 00:11:07.135
Hey.

00:11:07.204 --> 00:11:08.939
It must be ugly.

00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:11.332
"It must be ugly."

00:11:12.475 --> 00:11:13.601
Just eat.

00:11:13.848 --> 00:11:16.075
Don't ask to see the
picture when it comes out.

00:11:17.668 --> 00:11:18.855
No way.

00:11:19.652 --> 00:11:21.665
I won't ask for such an ugly picture.

00:11:29.867 --> 00:11:30.757
Look.

00:11:30.782 --> 00:11:31.782
Give it to me.

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:34.513
Give it.

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:38.036
Chewing, nom, nom, nom.

00:11:38.213 --> 00:11:39.600
Let me see.

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:43.076
It's cute, isn't it?

00:11:44.846 --> 00:11:45.979
No.

00:11:46.442 --> 00:11:47.715
Waste of film.

00:11:49.415 --> 00:11:50.538
It's not a waste.

00:11:54.768 --> 00:11:57.798
Next time, don't take
pictures of me while I'm eating.

00:12:30.104 --> 00:12:31.382
Hey, sweetie.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.807
The visa application for England,

00:12:33.831 --> 00:12:35.245
is it all done?

00:12:39.619 --> 00:12:41.186
It's all done, Mom.

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:43.594
That's good.

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:45.877
That you prepared early.

00:12:46.282 --> 00:12:49.305
As for the plane tickets,
I'll take care of them.

00:12:51.436 --> 00:12:52.462
Okay, Mom.

00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:03.836
Here, help me with the buttons.

00:13:04.568 --> 00:13:05.838
A little more here.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.293
Make it look neat.

00:13:08.318 --> 00:13:09.720
What are you two doing?

00:13:10.378 --> 00:13:13.107
Well, my son is about to become famous.

00:13:13.132 --> 00:13:14.913
So I have to dress to impress.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.147
You look so "Bang", Dad.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.672
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:20.696
Bang?

00:13:21.213 --> 00:13:22.380
What is "bang"?

00:13:22.547 --> 00:13:23.350
Very cool.

00:13:23.374 --> 00:13:24.469
Oh.

00:13:24.775 --> 00:13:25.998
Okay, very cool.

00:13:26.022 --> 00:13:27.113
Yeah, that's good.

00:13:27.137 --> 00:13:28.345
Where does "bang" come from?

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.916
- It's okay.
- Bang!

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:34.294
Okay, it means a loud noise.

00:13:34.325 --> 00:13:36.988
- A loud "Bang!" means cool, something like that?
- Yes.

00:13:37.468 --> 00:13:38.658
And who taught you this word?

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.703
Okay, never mind. It's okay.

00:13:41.728 --> 00:13:42.945
Do I look good?

00:13:43.065 --> 00:13:44.309
- You look good, Dad.
- I look good, right?

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:46.380
Okay, I won't embarrass
anyone like this, right?

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.974
Not unless you go singing
in the middle of the street.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.477
Oh, and who would do that?

00:13:53.558 --> 00:13:54.832
He's got so many jokes.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.390
Come here.

00:14:04.733 --> 00:14:05.902
So proud.

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:08.304
Thank you.

00:14:08.328 --> 00:14:09.737
I'm so proud, you know.

00:14:32.525 --> 00:14:34.379
"Become an artist and sell a million tapes"

00:14:53.047 --> 00:14:55.287
From now on, I can't support you guys much.

00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:00.839
I'm in the spotlight now.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.667
A lot of people are watching me.

00:15:05.437 --> 00:15:06.497
I understand, bro.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.364
Go follow your dream.

00:15:08.994 --> 00:15:11.620
We'll take care of the Red Hawk gang.

00:15:14.144 --> 00:15:16.053
But I still don't want to leave you guys.

00:15:17.304 --> 00:15:18.304
So,

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.392
that I can leave the Red
Hawk gang without any worries.

00:15:25.002 --> 00:15:26.531
You, you,

00:15:27.077 --> 00:15:28.074
you,

00:15:28.098 --> 00:15:29.172
and you.

00:15:29.558 --> 00:15:30.625
All of you.

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:32.156
Are you ready?

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:33.393
Ready!

00:15:33.418 --> 00:15:34.404
Let's go get Thoed.

00:15:34.428 --> 00:15:35.997
Let's finish this.

00:15:36.027 --> 00:15:37.264
- Let's do it!
- Let's go!

00:15:37.289 --> 00:15:39.379
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:15:50.656 --> 00:15:51.656
Why did you buy it?

00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:53.970
I told you not to buy it.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.879
But this is our son's work.

00:15:58.335 --> 00:15:59.370
This is not work.

00:15:59.394 --> 00:16:00.688
This is not called work.

00:16:02.078 --> 00:16:03.327
Anything that makes money

00:16:03.351 --> 00:16:04.905
is a job, isn't it?

00:16:05.017 --> 00:16:06.190
You said so yourself.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.753
Don't argue.

00:16:08.355 --> 00:16:10.243
I said no, and I mean no.

00:16:19.183 --> 00:16:20.330
When I wasn't making money,

00:16:21.282 --> 00:16:22.630
you said it wasn't a job.

00:16:27.296 --> 00:16:28.822
Now that I'm making money,

00:16:29.704 --> 00:16:30.984
you still say it's not a job.

00:16:31.507 --> 00:16:32.870
What else do you want?

00:16:34.707 --> 00:16:36.982
How stable is this job?

00:16:37.235 --> 00:16:39.825
How long can you make money from it?

00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:41.529
What is your definition of stability, Dad?

00:16:41.983 --> 00:16:44.707
Whether you run a business
or work for a company,

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.850
or whatever it is,

00:16:46.874 --> 00:16:48.754
it can fail too, can't it?

00:16:49.547 --> 00:16:51.376
And if your job is so stable,

00:16:52.529 --> 00:16:55.133
why do you have to stress
about work every day?

00:16:56.758 --> 00:16:58.005
It's not the same.

00:16:59.457 --> 00:17:02.661
Don't compare my work with what you do.

00:17:05.205 --> 00:17:07.167
If you insist that it's about income,

00:17:08.367 --> 00:17:09.413
then how about this?

00:17:09.853 --> 00:17:11.388
How much do you make a month?

00:17:12.483 --> 00:17:14.657
If one day I make more than you,

00:17:15.474 --> 00:17:16.608
will you accept it

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:19.317
and stop being prejudiced?

00:17:23.997 --> 00:17:25.719
If one day you make less than me,

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.440
do I have the right to order
you to do whatever I want?

00:17:30.746 --> 00:17:32.488
Just like you've done to me.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.973
Can I look down on and belittle

00:17:36.003 --> 00:17:37.877
your career however I want?

00:18:09.907 --> 00:18:10.907
Hey.

00:18:12.097 --> 00:18:13.817
Am I later than Chai?

00:18:14.682 --> 00:18:17.364
Hey, I've improved now.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.814
Have you heard of "Chai, a million tapes"?

00:18:20.124 --> 00:18:21.356
Chai, a million tapes?

00:18:21.913 --> 00:18:23.037
If you're a million tapes,

00:18:23.184 --> 00:18:24.990
then I'm "Nut, a million tapes" too.

00:18:26.532 --> 00:18:28.618
Then I must be "Win, a million tapes".

00:18:29.727 --> 00:18:30.420
As for me...

00:18:30.445 --> 00:18:31.445
Enough.

00:18:32.033 --> 00:18:33.400
I haven't even shown off yet.

00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:36.388
Can I be called "Lin, a million tapes"?

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.780
Hey, guys.

00:18:41.122 --> 00:18:44.181
Hey, don't tell me you're
a "million tapes" too.

00:18:44.441 --> 00:18:45.940
What the hell is a million tapes?

00:18:45.964 --> 00:18:47.870
Have you guys heard from Big, the producer?

00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:50.011
About what?

00:18:50.304 --> 00:18:52.326
We're going to have a concert!

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.516
Shit.

00:18:56.171 --> 00:18:58.680
Then I must be "Ek, two million tapes".

00:19:10.895 --> 00:19:13.537
Finally, a big concert.

00:19:13.562 --> 00:19:14.575
Let's do it.

00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:16.384
Chai, with this good news,

00:19:16.409 --> 00:19:17.582
should we go celebrate?

00:19:18.474 --> 00:19:19.629
Celebrate?

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.001
I want to celebrate with you.

00:19:22.326 --> 00:19:24.439
But I'm not free today.

00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:25.759
Oh.

00:19:25.835 --> 00:19:26.871
Then where are you going?

00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:29.864
Come on, it's an important matter.

00:19:29.927 --> 00:19:33.034
But just don't follow me.

00:19:35.095 --> 00:19:37.535
Just don't follow me, okay?

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.211
I told you not to follow me.

00:19:43.374 --> 00:19:44.535
Go inside the house.

00:19:54.796 --> 00:19:56.096
You're still not in the house.

00:19:56.582 --> 00:19:57.609
Go on.

00:20:25.094 --> 00:20:26.520
It's so amazing.

00:20:26.544 --> 00:20:28.819
I never thought a small
band could come this far.

00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:31.670
True, I'm so happy.

00:20:36.508 --> 00:20:38.148
Are there a lot of mosquitoes in England?

00:20:38.512 --> 00:20:39.840
Probably not many.

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:41.873
"Not many" means there are some.

00:20:48.476 --> 00:20:51.416
And how cold is it in England?

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.635
It's colder than here.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.523
But it mostly rains more.

00:20:59.107 --> 00:21:00.834
So you'll need a raincoat.

00:21:04.588 --> 00:21:06.201
That's too much, Biu.

00:21:09.104 --> 00:21:11.666
And are the tickets very expensive?

00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:15.700
They are expensive, and
you still need to get a visa.

00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:18.098
Why, are you going to follow me?

00:21:18.122 --> 00:21:19.122
Nope.

00:21:19.308 --> 00:21:20.757
If I were as rich as Ek,

00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:22.812
I'd buy a plane and fly after you.

00:21:23.437 --> 00:21:24.729
You're exaggerating.

00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:27.579
Just the thought of you coming with me,

00:21:28.164 --> 00:21:29.518
I'm already happy.

00:21:30.942 --> 00:21:33.056
So, when are you flying, Lin?

00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:35.242
Will you be here for the concert?

00:21:36.708 --> 00:21:38.384
The day after the concert.

00:21:38.415 --> 00:21:39.898
Hey, that's great.

00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:41.453
I thought I'd have to watch it alone.

00:21:50.812 --> 00:21:53.782
I thought you said you weren't free to
celebrate with your friends.

00:21:54.127 --> 00:21:56.280
But you're here with
me, just the two of us.

00:21:56.647 --> 00:21:58.134
I can only think of bad things.

00:22:00.103 --> 00:22:01.297
You're thinking right.

00:22:02.294 --> 00:22:03.367
Thinking right?

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.962
Thinking right about what?

00:22:06.262 --> 00:22:07.688
Do you know what I'm thinking?

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.051
Well, that I want to celebrate
with just the two of us.

00:22:13.077 --> 00:22:14.637
Or were you thinking of something else?

00:22:16.929 --> 00:22:18.755
No, I was...

00:22:19.469 --> 00:22:21.315
I was thinking what you were thinking.

00:22:26.632 --> 00:22:29.735
I wrote a song.

00:22:31.044 --> 00:22:32.564
I want you to be the first to hear it.

00:22:43.399 --> 00:22:46.826
♪ Remember the first day we met? ♪

00:22:46.851 --> 00:22:50.963

Do you like it?

00:23:31.128 --> 00:23:32.128
Yes.

00:23:34.385 --> 00:23:35.551
Like the song?

00:23:36.437 --> 00:23:37.704
Or like me?

00:23:42.032 --> 00:23:43.345
Both.

00:24:10.434 --> 00:24:11.554
Mmm..

00:24:13.437 --> 00:24:14.531
Can I ask you something?

00:24:15.488 --> 00:24:16.488
What?

00:24:17.874 --> 00:24:19.467
About the two of us,

00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:23.317
should I tell my dad?

00:24:25.287 --> 00:24:26.454
And the fans too.

00:24:27.817 --> 00:24:28.824
Or...

00:24:31.168 --> 00:24:32.710
should we keep hiding it like this?

00:24:38.085 --> 00:24:40.358
I think your dad

00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:42.578
probably already knows.

00:24:43.813 --> 00:24:46.408
He just might not be able to say much.

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:50.207
Then let's tell him later.

00:24:50.813 --> 00:24:52.768
For now, let your dad play dumb.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.574
"Play dumb"?

00:24:56.317 --> 00:24:57.597
Is that a new word?

00:24:58.121 --> 00:24:59.262
It's easy to understand.

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:05.055
And what about the fans?

00:25:09.729 --> 00:25:10.770
With the fans,

00:25:12.038 --> 00:25:14.542
I think in this era,

00:25:15.489 --> 00:25:16.625
it's better not to yet.

00:25:17.742 --> 00:25:19.069
Yeah, I think so too.

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:23.080
But you talk like we can
reveal it in another era.

00:25:26.793 --> 00:25:28.066
Want to bet?

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:32.752
In about another 20 years,

00:25:34.802 --> 00:25:36.429
our love

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.412
will have everyone's support.

00:25:39.652 --> 00:25:41.342
And our marriage

00:25:42.209 --> 00:25:43.650
will be legal too.

00:25:45.673 --> 00:25:46.812
Are you kidding?

00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:50.680
So to know the result,

00:25:52.235 --> 00:25:53.734
we have to wait another 20 years?

00:25:54.843 --> 00:25:55.964
Why?

00:25:55.989 --> 00:25:57.790
Are you not going to
be with me for 20 years?

00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:00.119
No way.

00:26:01.212 --> 00:26:02.813
40 years is too short.

00:26:04.151 --> 00:26:05.471
Then,

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.643
what does the loser have to do?

00:26:12.773 --> 00:26:14.210
The loser has to

00:26:15.163 --> 00:26:18.340
stay with the winner for another 60 years.

00:26:20.069 --> 00:26:21.179
Wow.

00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:23.500
That's serious.

00:26:24.805 --> 00:26:26.833
I thought you said 40 years was too short.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.401
Deal?

00:26:52.923 --> 00:26:54.263
Thank you all so much.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.765
For always risking danger with me.

00:26:58.082 --> 00:26:59.781
We should be the ones thanking you.

00:26:59.812 --> 00:27:01.019
For not leaving us.

00:27:02.901 --> 00:27:04.067
Then today,

00:27:05.331 --> 00:27:06.771
we will fight with dignity,

00:27:07.963 --> 00:27:09.803
like it's our last battle.

00:27:10.813 --> 00:27:11.535
Let's do it.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.128
- Let's do it!
- Let's go!

00:27:13.153 --> 00:27:13.870
Let's do it.

00:27:13.895 --> 00:27:16.323
1, 2, 3, go!

00:27:17.973 --> 00:27:19.540
What are you guys going to fight?

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.004
Who the hell is that?

00:27:23.612 --> 00:27:25.145
I told you not to follow me.

00:27:25.965 --> 00:27:27.325
Are you going to get into a fight?

00:27:28.177 --> 00:27:29.697
It's called the final battle.

00:27:30.712 --> 00:27:32.480
I'm going to fight Thoed for the last time.

00:27:33.447 --> 00:27:34.933
So we can settle this.

00:27:35.386 --> 00:27:36.662
So the story can end.

00:27:37.112 --> 00:27:39.938
Is this the last thing
that's bothering you?

00:27:40.332 --> 00:27:42.121
The reason you're not ready to be with me?

00:27:42.891 --> 00:27:43.891
Yes.

00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:46.070
As long as Thoed's gang

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.272
is still bullying my guys,

00:27:49.352 --> 00:27:50.800
you won't be safe.

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:53.571
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

00:27:54.662 --> 00:27:56.385
That's why I have to clear this up today.

00:27:58.119 --> 00:27:59.812
So the reason you won't be with me

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:01.865
is because of this little thing?

00:28:03.989 --> 00:28:05.424
It's not just a little thing.

00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:07.428
- Thoed's gang...
- Wait a minute, Chai.

00:28:08.283 --> 00:28:09.795
If it's because of this little thing,

00:28:10.262 --> 00:28:11.697
you should have told me sooner.

00:28:32.115 --> 00:28:34.701
Hey, have you seen Chai's gang?

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.601
Do you guys have a problem with Chai?

00:28:43.382 --> 00:28:45.009
He likes to start trouble with us.

00:28:45.856 --> 00:28:47.013
Is that all?

00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:48.226
Yeah.

00:28:49.348 --> 00:28:52.453
Then if both sides stop starting trouble,

00:28:52.477 --> 00:28:53.853
the matter will be over, right?

00:28:54.317 --> 00:28:55.431
Yes.

00:28:56.495 --> 00:28:57.895
Then from this day on,

00:28:57.919 --> 00:28:59.426
the Red Hawk gang will
stop starting trouble with you.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.778
And you guys will stop starting trouble
with the Red Hawk gang.

00:29:01.802 --> 00:29:02.828
Is it over?

00:29:03.182 --> 00:29:05.422
What are you talking
about? Are you asking us to...

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.653
Uh... actually, it can be over.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:24.685
Right, guys?

00:29:24.812 --> 00:29:26.495
- Yes, yes.
- I agree.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.867
- Let's go, it's over.
- I have other things to do.

00:29:29.127 --> 00:29:30.500
Is it really over?

00:29:31.702 --> 00:29:33.135
Yeah, really.

00:29:33.508 --> 00:29:35.221
We keep our word.

00:29:35.514 --> 00:29:36.715
Right, guys?

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.285
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.689
We keep our word.

00:29:44.445 --> 00:29:45.565
Let's go.

00:30:05.096 --> 00:30:06.096
Mom.

00:30:08.479 --> 00:30:09.996
I'm having a concert.

00:30:11.224 --> 00:30:12.557
Do you want tickets?

00:30:13.757 --> 00:30:14.757
Yes.

00:30:21.636 --> 00:30:22.996

The matter with Thoed's gang is over.

00:32:16.947 --> 00:32:19.454
So can we be together now?

00:32:28.017 --> 00:32:29.277
I've been...

00:32:31.936 --> 00:32:33.256
waiting for this for a long time.

00:32:47.649 --> 00:32:48.649
Here.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.447
I'm returning this as promised.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.255
Then I'll be going now.

00:33:10.935 --> 00:33:12.306
Wait, Biu.

00:33:21.192 --> 00:33:22.605
I think

00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:25.679
I like you too, Biu.

00:33:27.207 --> 00:33:29.440
I don't know if you still like me now.

00:33:29.815 --> 00:33:33.455
But if you're still single when
I get back from England...

00:34:01.677 --> 00:34:03.480
60 years isn't enough.

Talk to me like this...

00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:16.495
do we know each other?

00:35:16.727 --> 00:35:18.127
Shit.

00:35:18.947 --> 00:35:20.121
You!

00:35:22.193 --> 00:35:23.393
I just wanted to invite you...

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.569
Hey!

00:35:24.594 --> 00:35:25.594
Ouch!

00:35:29.701 --> 00:35:30.908
Is this your friend's?

00:35:32.842 --> 00:35:33.842
Nut.

00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:37.723
You dropped your wallet.

00:35:46.533 --> 00:35:48.012
Should we start a band?

00:35:57.554 --> 00:35:58.460
Ek.

00:35:58.485 --> 00:35:59.442
Ek, wait.

00:35:59.467 --> 00:36:00.467
Ek.

00:36:00.556 --> 00:36:01.596
About the band, Ek.

00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:02.621
Win.

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.309
I think you should meet the doctor.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.229
I probably just didn't eat enough.

00:36:13.821 --> 00:36:15.374
Here, I made this for you.

00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:17.893
So you can eat all your meals.

00:36:18.004 --> 00:36:19.525
So you won't faint again.

00:36:19.828 --> 00:36:21.300
So tired.

00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:24.956
Nut.

00:36:25.143 --> 00:36:26.596
Nut.

00:36:26.888 --> 00:36:27.897
Are you okay?

00:36:28.624 --> 00:36:30.205
You have to sleep now, you know.

00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:31.743
Just like the doctor ordered.

00:36:32.372 --> 00:36:33.585
Is that all you called for?

00:36:36.053 --> 00:36:37.077
Good night.

00:36:39.483 --> 00:36:41.051
We're close to the competition.

00:36:41.075 --> 00:36:42.978
So I want to practice a little more.

00:36:45.406 --> 00:36:46.526
Is that all?

00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:50.319
I wanted to talk to you alone.

00:36:59.215 --> 00:37:00.467
Why are you running?

00:37:00.491 --> 00:37:02.083
You're going to faint again.

00:37:02.756 --> 00:37:04.391
If I feel unwell,

00:37:04.415 --> 00:37:06.080
I'll tell you first.

00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:09.113
Stop worrying about me.

00:37:09.549 --> 00:37:12.296
And, did you get a new haircut?

00:37:15.115 --> 00:37:16.194
This style

00:37:17.387 --> 00:37:18.527
is pretty cute too.

00:37:21.766 --> 00:37:23.734
I used to think that I
wanted to have a band,

00:37:25.683 --> 00:37:27.402
and invite everyone to go camping,

00:37:28.015 --> 00:37:30.055
to sit and eat moo krata
like this for a long time.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.407
You're like you know my heart.

00:37:35.687 --> 00:37:37.328
We only have one tent?

00:37:37.353 --> 00:37:38.353
Yes.

00:37:38.903 --> 00:37:40.350
Win, you can sleep with me.

00:37:46.995 --> 00:37:48.019
Good night.

00:37:51.065 --> 00:37:54.487
What's wrong with you lately?

00:37:54.952 --> 00:37:57.392
Suddenly you're being unusually nice to me.

00:38:00.659 --> 00:38:01.659
And you?

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.849
A while ago you were being
unusually nice to me too.

00:38:23.477 --> 00:38:24.617
What now?

00:38:25.843 --> 00:38:27.258
Want to sleep in my room?

00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:11.616
I don't have to do anything.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.710
Hey.

00:39:12.896 --> 00:39:14.498
You better watch out.

00:39:14.522 --> 00:39:15.910
There's a gangster around here.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:17.805
What?

00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:19.325
You better hide well.

00:39:20.384 --> 00:39:21.957
Dang Bireley.

00:39:21.982 --> 00:39:24.438
Wowww...

00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:29.980
Do you know why this is called popcorn?

00:39:30.005 --> 00:39:30.873
Why?

00:39:30.898 --> 00:39:32.533
Because Popeye is a cartoon.

00:39:38.617 --> 00:39:40.837
You forgot to zip your pants.

00:39:47.168 --> 00:39:48.608
This is almost finished.

00:39:59.695 --> 00:40:01.009
What?

00:40:01.034 --> 00:40:02.590
We have to be still.

00:40:06.956 --> 00:40:09.028
Everyone, smile and laugh.

00:40:09.053 --> 00:40:10.663
Hey, he's going for the handsome way.

00:40:12.477 --> 00:40:14.307
That's more like it, guys.

00:40:14.332 --> 00:40:15.840
He's going to break.

00:40:15.865 --> 00:40:17.428
Don't pretentious.

00:40:19.694 --> 00:40:20.921
Don't pretentious.

00:40:23.191 --> 00:40:25.337
Everyone, this is Lin.

00:40:26.266 --> 00:40:27.572
My friend from middle school.

00:40:28.045 --> 00:40:31.575
Lin, this is Win, our lead singer.

00:40:32.602 --> 00:40:33.648
This is Ek...

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.791
This is Chai, the drummer.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.817
This is Ek, the guitarist.

00:40:43.532 --> 00:40:45.387
And this is Biu, the bassist.

00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:48.721
This scene is so messed up.

00:40:54.024 --> 00:40:56.264
I wish I could play the drums forever.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:58.703
Forever?

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.257
Yes.

00:41:02.846 --> 00:41:03.920
Nut.

00:41:12.947 --> 00:41:13.947
Come here.

00:41:15.535 --> 00:41:16.955
Don't you want to be brave?

00:41:23.308 --> 00:41:25.035
Hey, this guy.

00:41:28.769 --> 00:41:31.249
Not yet, still haven't cut.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.643
Opal is posing like this.

00:41:40.676 --> 00:41:41.964
I think,

00:41:42.863 --> 00:41:44.077
I like Nut.

00:41:49.779 --> 00:41:51.479
I want to confess my love.

00:41:52.089 --> 00:41:53.962
Can you find the right moment for me, Win?

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:59.490
Of course, Lin.

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.540
Before you confess your love to Nut,

00:42:04.173 --> 00:42:06.110
don't forget to order the chocolate sundae

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.047
with lots of chocolate sprinkles.

00:42:08.477 --> 00:42:09.555
Oh, and also,

00:42:09.833 --> 00:42:11.993
don't order more than 1
bowl, he'll get a stomachache.

00:42:12.181 --> 00:42:14.270
I'm done, I'm going to bed.

00:42:14.705 --> 00:42:17.281
Hey, where are you going? Wait.

00:42:18.368 --> 00:42:20.925
If the ghost is drunk, then ghunk is drost

00:42:22.662 --> 00:42:24.042
"ghunk is drost."

00:42:25.393 --> 00:42:26.483
What is that?

00:42:26.508 --> 00:42:28.490
I don't know either.

00:42:34.781 --> 00:42:36.675
No one is helping me.

00:42:50.042 --> 00:42:51.429
- Does it hurt?
- It hurts.

00:42:56.516 --> 00:42:57.703
Win.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.701
Actually, you like Nut too, right?

00:43:04.524 --> 00:43:05.954
Whether I like him or not,

00:43:06.938 --> 00:43:08.500
it doesn't matter, Lin.

00:43:10.607 --> 00:43:12.830
Anyway, right nhow~

00:43:19.977 --> 00:43:21.335
Hey, do you see this, Opal?

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.815
Where is this person from?
