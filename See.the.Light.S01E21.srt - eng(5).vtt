00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.040
Si Jiali's notes.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.120
When I was 21,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.840
when I was 21.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.480
I like writing stories about women.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.200
I can say I like creating.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.440
my ideal

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.240
independent and powerful image.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480
At first, no one was interested in my novel,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.240
But there was only one loyal reader.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.760
wrote to me every month

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.440
to express her appreciation for me.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.680
Her letter supported my confidence in writing.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480
[That's how I kept writing.]

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.480
The heavens live up to the people who care.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.760
I finally became a best-selling author.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360
[Then, through letters,]

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.200
through letters.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.440
Her name is Miaomiao.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.520
Soon,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.320
became best friends.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.520
We often meet.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.120
Through getting closer to each other,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.520
I gradually realized

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.080
the dark past

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.120
in Miaomiao’s pure heart.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.640
I have something to tell you.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.680
What is it?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.680
We often read books and joke together.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.760
She was happy every time we met.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.320
But I still found

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.880
Miaomiao

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.040
in Miao’s eyes.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.560
And after a long time,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.040
I found that she would disappear on weekends

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.600
and then we met again.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.600
she was very unstable.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.920
Tell me what happened.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.560
I can only help you if you tell me.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.520
That’s when I knew

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.079
Miaomiao lived

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.560
under the mental control of an elder.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.760
She wanted to escape.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.520
but she had no choice.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.120
She didn't want to tell me

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.280
her name.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.720
She only told me

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.760
that person is something that can't be shaken.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.800
This is my first time too.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.680
I was at a loss.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.120
So I gave Miao an idea

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.520
to collect evidence of that person.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.200
I'll report the case with her.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.240
So Si Jiali is the author.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.520
I've been investigating for seven years.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.760
I really didn't realize

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.640
The author and Geum Mu are not the same person.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.040
Who is Jinmu?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.280
I don't know yet.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.079
Let’s see.

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.000
Miaomiao.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.160
Miaomiao.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.080
So I waited for her news.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.720
But what I waited for

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.640
was an accident.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.280
Maybe because of me,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.360
because of me.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.600
So I chose to use the rest of my life

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.720
to find out the person Miao mentioned.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.000
So on the day Miao jumped off the building,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.080
when Miaomiao jumped off the building.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.159
So the reason why she did this

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.280
because of your sister, Miaomiao.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.680
All these years,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.080
I’ve been looking for Miaomiao

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.520
through various ways.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.280
During this process,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.200
I met a group of comrades with the same goal.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.880
We've been planning for years.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.080
we visited many places

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.840
and saved countless women in abyss.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.800
It's salvation

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.960
but also for a good result.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.000
Gradually,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.200
we found that person

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.200
and confirmed Miao’s condition.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.800
But that person

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.360
found our existence.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.480
Yuanshan Nursing Home.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.400
Miaomiao.

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.960
Zhou Mu.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.360
I understand how you feel now.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.680
But as you can see,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.960
You might be targeted too.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.960
So, calm down.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.520
Okay.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.800
I'll send Qin Shan over first.

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.720
Let's go.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.440
Hello, nurse.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.720
I want to visit

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.400
Patient No. 01023, Zhou Miao.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.800
Who are you to her?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400
I'm a friend of his brother.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.920
He asked me to take care of him.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.440
This is my ID.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.880
Don't worry.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.560
Come with me.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.080
Okay.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.320
Since he's your friend,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.280
why didn't you come once?

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.360
What a pity.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.440
Such a beautiful girl

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.800
fell down from the third floor.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
He hit his head and hurt his brain.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.680
Although he was out of danger,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.760
I survived.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.200
But basically no one knows him now.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.480
Right here.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.880
The patient is recovering well.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.680
He's just unconscious.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.000
As her family,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.520
you should come over and spend more time with her.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.680
Okay, thank you.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.360
Can I

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.760
for her?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.040
Now?

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.880
Yes.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.800
Are you kidding me?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.560
At least tomorrow.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.280
And his family has to come in person.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.320
Bring the proof.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:31.920
Okay.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.920
I'll stay here with her tonight.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.560
But...

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.240
Don't worry.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.760
I'll rest outside.
