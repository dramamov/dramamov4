00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.340
Kicking Song Zhizhi out
of Starlight Jewelry

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.780
is their goal.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.620
Wei Ziming

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.140
is lovesick, bitter,
and twisted by hatred.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.860
Now, with Ye Taiting
brainwashing him daily,

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.100
he's lost all rationality.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.860
I'm afraid

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.140
they'll stop at nothing.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.460
Thank you for telling me this.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.140
To be honest, I wasn't recording.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.220
I never believed your loyalty
to Ye Taiting was unshakable.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:33.820
Maybe

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.860
one day we'll end up on the same side.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.780
Contact me

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.460
when you've come around.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.060
Ziming,

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.380
just say what's on your mind.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.820
I had lawyers compile
the investigative report

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.500
on the car accident
involving Ye Shengheng,

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.580
now known as Ji Baijian,

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.620
and his parents.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.620
On the day of the accident,

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.540
Ye Xiaoting's last call

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.660
was to you.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.100
You planned to have dinner together

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.740
and reminisce.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.060
But you arrived early.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.460
And Ye Xiaoting never showed up.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.580
You knew his route

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.140
and timing perfectly.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.660
Yet you told the police

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.100
that last five-minute call

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.540
was just to remind him to hurry.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.340
After that call,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.540
he made a decision

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.060
that baffled everyone.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.180
What are you trying to say?

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.980
He was originally driving
with his family

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.060
on the outer ring road.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.740
Longer, but smoother.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.380
Probably because his wife and child
were with him.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.020
But halfway,

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.060
he suddenly turned around

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.780
and took a shorter

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.940
but more remote route.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.060
The accident happened there.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.500
I think your call

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.380
led to that decision.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.620
So indirectly,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.220
you're also responsible for the deaths
of Ye Xiaoting and his wife.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.180
Then Ji Baijian
is too dangerous for you all!

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.180
He's getting close
to the Song family and Zhizhi

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.860
just to uncover the truth
about what happened.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.140
Once he finds out,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.940
it'll drive an irreparable wedge

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.620
between him and Zhizhi.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.620
Zhizhi'll never be happy!

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.300
Even if she doesn't end up
with Ji Baijian,

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.540
I won't let her be with you!

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.300
You'd use this to pressure me?

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.300
You're truly Ye Taiting's son.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.820
Even your tactics are just like his.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.380
You've disappointed me so much!

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.780
Why?

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.860
After everything Ji Baijian has done,

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.180
why do you still take his side?

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.980
Do you still see me

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.420
as that helpless orphan?

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.660
Wei Ziming,

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.460
I hope you turn back now

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.140
and cut ties with Ye Taiting!

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.260
Otherwise, forget Zhizhi,

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:33.940
even I

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.140
won't want to see you again.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.860
Come on out.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.500
You left such a mess

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.380
with that thing back then.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.540
Not just Ji Baijian
is digging into the accident.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.580
Just now, my son...

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.980
My son Wei Ziming called

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.260
and asked me about the accident too.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.700
It's about to blow wide open.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.060
Explain this to me.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.020
What is going on here?

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.780
Don't worry.
I'll look into it right away!

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.580
Look into what? You idiot!

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.780
Let me ask you,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.780
was it that driver you hired...?

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.260
That driver threw me
under the bus, right?

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:45.980
Mr. Ye,

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.180
that driver was dealt with long ago.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.660
We sent money to his family
for five years.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.460
Well, this is interesting.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.900
It couldn't have been me.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.660
Who else could it be?

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.380
Well,

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.820
that only leaves you.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.940
I looked into the driver's family.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.820
Qian Guanshu had been
sending them money all along.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.420
If it was really just an accident,

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.940
then why has he kept

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.180
sending money to his mother?

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.420
The Song family

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.940
wronged Ji Baijian.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.620
I made a mistake back then
with the Ji family's

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.260
rough gemstones.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.940
Then, with the Ye family's car accident,

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.300
I made another mistake.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.860
With every mistake,

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.340
I pushed an innocent Ji Baijian

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.660
deeper into despair.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.780
Among the partners of Starlight Group,

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.820
Ye Xiaoting was upright and principled,

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.500
while Ye Taiting

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.460
always cut corners,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.340
chasing profits in gray areas.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.900
Disapproving of Ye Taiting's actions,

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.620
Ji Yunlei left Starlight Group
and established Dafu Jewelry.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.860
Later, when Ye Taiting's schemes
came to light,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.820
Ye Xiaoting found out.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.620
He turned his own brother in,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.020
exposing his deeds

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.540
and forcing him out of the company.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.340
That's when the two brothers broke ties.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.460
Ye Taiting grew to resent his brother.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.580
This time, I'm not listening to you!

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.580
Let's call it quits!

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:46.980
What are you doing?

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.340
What are you doing?

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:48.780
Ye Taiting!

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.260
I'm telling you,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.300
from now on,

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.340
we'll just

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.260
go our separate ways!

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:53.780
Get out!

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.500
Taiting!

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.140
So, is that when

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.780
you got involved?

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.900
Not exactly involved.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.340
But I was there.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.620
Among the founding partners,

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.620
Ye Taiting and I were the closest.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.700
So he came to me.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.620
He asked me to invite his brother out.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.820
Said he wanted to apologize in person.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.460
I really didn't think much of it.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.300
They were brothers, after all.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.340
So

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.380
I believed him.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.020
Alright, Xiaoting.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.300
See you soon.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.060
Alright.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.660
He'll be here soon.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.340
He is

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.700
bringing his wife and son this time.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.380
Good.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.540
Even better if they all come.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.900
Their whole family can be together.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.940
Everyone's here.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.500
Shan, I have to take this call.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.660
Sir,

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.460
the vehicle you mentioned
never showed up.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.060
They're not coming?

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.900
Understood.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.300
What's wrong?

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.860
Something happened?

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.860
Look at my brother.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.860
Instead of taking the good road,

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.700
he took the old road.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.220
That road had a landslide recently.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.740
Unbelievable.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:29.780
And it's the longer route.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.780
Shan, why don't you

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.980
call him? Use your name.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.940
Tell him not to take that road.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.660
Then, which route should he take?

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.380
The newly paved road.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.740
Right, I know that one.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:50.540
Hello?

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.100
Xiaoting, listen,

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.620
there's been a landslide
on your current route.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.700
Switch to the new road.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.620
Yes, that one.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.660
Alright, we'll be waiting for you.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.580
Alright.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:04.900
Done.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.380
Shan, you're good.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.300
So he listened to you

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.700
and changed routes?

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.100
Yes.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.140
He took

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.460
the new route I suggested

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.860
and had a car accident.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.100
Originally,

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.220
Ye Xiaoting was coming alone.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.700
But he was so happy.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.260
So he brought his wife and kid.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.900
Who would've thought...

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:58.820
Dad,

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.580
don't blame yourself.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.300
You didn't know

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.180
about that.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.260
I thought

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.180
it was an accident too.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.460
Until I learned

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.660
there was never any landslide

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.180
on their original route!

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.660
So Ye Taiting

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.660
lied to you.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.460
I confronted him.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.980
Asked why he lied.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.620
He threatened me

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.220
and said since I made the call

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.140
and suggested the route.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.180
And if this ever came out,

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.780
their deaths

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.940
would be on me.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.300
Dad,

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.820
this isn't your fault.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.860
Ye Taiting.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.540
He planned

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.940
the whole thing.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:58.820
Mr. Ye,

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.460
you suspect me?

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.300
You're breaking my heart.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.860
I've been with you for over 20 years.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.180
I've done every dirty job you handed me.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.740
When you said jump,
I never asked why.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.220
We're on the same boat.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.660
Back then,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.980
you told me

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.620
you had issues with your brother.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.700
Song Shan set up that dinner

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.540
to mediate.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.460
You said

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.260
you didn't want Ye Xiaoting there.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.660
Told me to handle him.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.260
After that,

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.700
you've sent money
to the driver for five years.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.820
A million.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.900
That came from your pockets.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.580
And yes,

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.700
I gave him the final route.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.860
But you know well

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.580
whether there were landslides

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.060
on that route

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.460
they originally chose.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.420
Guanshu.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.220
Guanshu,

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.220
what is that talk?

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.460
I was just saying.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.340
You actually took it seriously?

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.020
You're something else.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.340
All these years,

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.140
I treated you like my own brother.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:54.820
Mr. Ye,

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.820
I've always seen you
as my own brother too.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.220
That's why

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.700
I usually acted

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.660
with your direct orders.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.700
You've carried

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.700
a heavy burden all these years.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.180
There's a board meeting tomorrow.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.420
Go back and get some rest.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.260
Go home and rest.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.020
Guanshu,

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.980
where were you last night?

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.180
At home, drinking and watching the game.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.420
Just asking.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.340
It's nothing.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.460
Go get some rest.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.340
Take care on your way.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.620
[Ji Baijian]

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.060
Hello? Hello?

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.260
We're here today

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.260
for an internal board meeting.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.260
For the upcoming tasks,

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.940
I'm going to hand them over

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.140
to a remarkably capable young man.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.420
He will take on the role
of Executive Director

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.100
and address these issues.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.660
Let's welcome

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.260
our new Executive Director,

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.420
Mr. Wei Ziming!

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.620
Have a seat, Ziming.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.420
I'm sure I don't need to
introduce Ziming in detail.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.980
He's the Deputy General Manager
of Starlight Jewelry

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.660
and a key young talent

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.380
the group has been cultivating

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.300
these years.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.500
I propose

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.020
that Wei Ziming also oversee
Starlight Jewelry's operations

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.740
on behalf of the group,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.020
with veto power.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.380
I object!

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.340
I am the General Manager
of Starlight Jewelry.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.860
I don't oppose Wei Ziming

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.700
participating in our daily operations

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.460
and management.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.740
But with veto power?

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.340
On what grounds?

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.020
Zhizhi,

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.020
I hope there's no misunderstanding here.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.980
We all want what's best for the group.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.940
The bid for Drizzt

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.540
is crucial

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.260
for us.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.260
So I want Ziming

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.900
to lend you his support.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.180
Ziming, say something.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.180
I'm honored to serve as Acting Director

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.780
and to work with Zhizhi

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.420
on securing the bid for Drizzt.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.140
I believe

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.140
I won't let the group down.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:52.740
Ji Baijian?

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.100
What are you doing here?

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.500
You know exactly why I'm here.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.900
I oppose the resolution just passed.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.580
Mr. Ji Baijian,

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.500
on what grounds

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.060
do you object

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.620
to our internal meeting?

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.140
I am Ye Shengheng,
son of the late chairman

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.700
of Starlight Group,

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.540
Ye Xiaoting.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.420
Shengheng?

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.180
It's really you?

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.620
Shengheng,

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.260
it is you.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.980
You're alive.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.740
I searched for you for so long.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.380
Let me get a good look at you.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.380
My boy,

00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.460
I've made offerings

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.740
to your parents and you every year.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.220
Why didn't you

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.780
come home to me?

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.700
Come home to you?

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.380
All these years,

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.500
you never stopped

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.820
trying to have me killed, did you?

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.500
If I had come to you,

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.100
I probably wouldn't be alive today.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.020
Kid,

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.140
I don't know what you mean.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.420
My parents were murdered.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.460
Kid,

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.420
the police didn't find any evidence

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.340
that it was a murder.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.620
Don't just make wild guesses.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:51.980
Evidence, you say?

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.780
You should be familiar

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.060
with this watch, right?

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.900
Why did you bring this here?

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.980
It is evidence!

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.380
Destroy it now.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.420
What about this watch?

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.020
Let your secretary, Qian Guanshu,

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.660
explain this.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.260
Was Qian Guanshu behind this too?

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.100
Qian Guanshu is just a secretary.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.940
Would he dare do any of this

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.860
without you pulling the strings?

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.540
Ye Taiting,

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.980
someone will come forward today

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.140
and explain everything to everyone.
