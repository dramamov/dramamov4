(The Strange Perfume)

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.840
The Lord of Wujian
graces my humble home.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.960
Truly an honor.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.119
I'm warning you,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.119
don't go after the Mei pearl again,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.119
and don't harm Lu Huayan.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.600
You're one of Wujian.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.359
You can't love a human.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.159
You became Lord of Wujian

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.879
only because Father
favoured you and your mother.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.879
Your status came through her,
and that's why you inherited the throne.

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:08.359
What gives you the right to order me?

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.159
You recognised your lover
from a century ago.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.000
I helped you kill her.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.879
You should be thanking me.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:18.760
No matter what our fate is,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.040
no matter what the rules of Wujian are,

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.079
I am the Lord of Wujian.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.640
If you dare touch her,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.799
I'll destroy your soul.

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.400
Li Motong,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.280
as the Lord of Wujian,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.599
you keep falling for the same woman.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.040
How disgraceful.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.879
Lu.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.400
Lu, look.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.760
This is perfume brought from France

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.719
by Inspector Li Motong himself,
at great expense.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.040
One bottle for each of us.

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.120
This one's yours.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.680
Smells nice, doesn't it?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.159
Let's go.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.560
Lu Huayan, you really have tough luck.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.039
You can even get away
after killing someone.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.319
I didn't kill anyone.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.280
Didn't you say you
weren't competing with me?

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.240
All the performance slots
this week are yours.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.719
Don't you think you're being too greedy?

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.120
It was Lan's arrangement.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.039
If you've got a problem, talk to her.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.080
Why would she arrange that?

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.479
Of course it's because you, Miss Lu,

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.039
are such a charmer.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.919
You please the guests more.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.039
But what trick did you use

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.039
to make them all so obsessed with you?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.159
Do I have to spell it out?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.560
Seems like

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.240
your greatest skill
isn't your performance on stage,

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.080
but your other talents.

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:10.439
Say one more word,

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.560
and I'll cut your face open.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.400
You wouldn't dare.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.039
Try me and see if I dare.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.639
Listen carefully.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.680
All my life, I, Lu Huayan,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.120
have survived
by being ruthless to myself,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.439
and ruthless to my enemies.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.479
You don't know how to behave?

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.439
Then I'll teach you how to act human.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.680
Get out.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.159
(Li Motong.)

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.479
(Are you an enemy or a friend?)

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.439
Master Jing, don't be angry.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.839
I've already sent the Soul-Loss Incense
to the Paramount in Li Motong's name.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.240
Once those humans use it,

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.680
tonight I'll control
their souls and frame him.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.040
Then Li Motong
won't escape Wujian's punishment

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.519
and will obediently return to Wujian.

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:31.399
Good.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.680
But I want you
to wound both body and heart.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.879
They must not fall in love.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.759
Lu Huayan must die tonight.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.839
(This perfume smells so strange.)

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:00.079
Who are you?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.920
What do you want?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.120
I want

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.720
your life.

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:26.600
The Lord of Wujian.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:53.399
Come with me.

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:54.960
What's going on?

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:57.919
Lan, why are we here?

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.850
It's all right, Mengmeng.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.480
I'm not sure what happened.

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:02.879
Come on, let's go back first.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.399
Mr. Li.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.480
Is that you?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.320
I can't see anymore.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.279
It's me.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.679
They actually stole your eyes.

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:36.480
It's my fault.

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:39.000
I didn't protect you.

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:47.879
I heard footsteps just now.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.120
Is someone else here too?

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.279
How are they?

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:52.759
They're fine.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.799
They inhaled the Soul-Loss Incense,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.960
but I've already lifted
the spell on them.

00:09:58.159 --> 00:09:59.559
Thank you, Mr. Li.

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:01.440
I didn't expect

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.919
that you would care about human lives.

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:06.080
Yan.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.879
There are good and bad humans.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.320
We of Wujian are the same.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.960
Not all of us

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.960
are as bad as you imagine.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.250
But right now the most important thing

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.679
is to help you get your eyes back.

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:28.480
Let's go.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:29.919
I'll take you home first.
