"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 8)

00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:50.664
Sasin?

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.591
Pin?

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.531
Sasin?

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.880
What're you doing?

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.731
Is he still sleeping?

00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:25.718
Sasin?

00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:29.120
Are you okay?

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.560
Why're you here?

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.400
- I…
- He's here to scold me.

00:02:52.223 --> 00:02:54.040
I dragged him to join
me on a boat, got stuck

00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:55.784
on the island and caused some troubles.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.321
Right?

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.040
- But I…
- Why do you want to see me?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680
I don't feel good that

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.440
Saenkaew's dad doesn't seem
like he likes you very much.

00:03:19.637 --> 00:03:20.960
I'd like to ask you

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:23.640
to apologize to him properly.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.400
If one day,

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:31.440
Pin and Saenkaew get married,

00:03:31.916 --> 00:03:33.596
we will be like family.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.760
I love you like my real brother

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.800
and I don't want him to feel bad about you.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.400
Please?

00:04:00.117 --> 00:04:02.100
Apologize to him with me

00:04:02.837 --> 00:04:04.280
and I'll help talking to him.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.951
Fine.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.080
I don't want you to
feel bad about it either.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.201
Sure. I'll arrange the meeting.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.520
I'll apologize to him with you.

00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:29.062
Thank you.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.020
What's wrong with you?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.720
Why did your buttons look like that?

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.056
How old are you?

00:04:59.683 --> 00:05:00.684
Let me help you.

00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:07.567
You should wear it properly.

00:05:29.143 --> 00:05:31.760
Kalong!

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.360
He rushed me to stop the wedding.

00:05:34.757 --> 00:05:36.560
If you think that it's
easy, then you do it!

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.240
What should we do?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.960
If we can't stop the wedding.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.360
Kalong will get us for sure.

00:05:49.037 --> 00:05:52.320
You shouldn't have
betrayed your brother like that.

00:05:54.177 --> 00:05:55.190
My dear,

00:05:55.512 --> 00:05:57.560
if you're not gonna make it better,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.761
at least don't give me more headaches.

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:02.735
My head hurts enough as it is.

00:06:36.977 --> 00:06:39.560
Where're you going?

00:06:40.263 --> 00:06:41.370
Come back here.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.760
I'll teach you how to
put together a garland

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.200
to give to Saenkaew's
dad, along with your apology.

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:53.240
I went to the flower market this morning,
and prepared flowers for you.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.440
It seems so complicated,
why don't you do it for me?

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.400
No, you need to do it yourself

00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:02.522
to show your sincerity.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.251
I'll teach you.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:09.871
Get the needles

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.800
and then you need to

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.840
pick beautiful flowers like this.

00:07:15.463 --> 00:07:17.600
Then stick them in the middle.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.631
Right,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.120
Ms. Rachawadee invited both you
and Saenkaew to the night club.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.560
I think if you asked Prince
Kamfah to go, he wouldn't mind.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.960
Sure, let's go.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.720
I haven't heard Mingmitr's
singing voice in a long time.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.240
We should hurry up and finish this.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.440
I'll help you.

00:07:59.337 --> 00:08:01.320
Let me see how you do it.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:09.811
Like that.

00:08:28.277 --> 00:08:31.760
Should we get some noodles
at the same place after this?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.808
I haven't visited that
place in such a long time.

00:08:33.832 --> 00:08:34.400
Sure.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.480
I need to use a bathroom
real quick and I'll be right back.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.880
I don't have a problem
with marriage certificates

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.480
but to protect both of us about this.

00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:12.160
I've drafted a loan agreement

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.320
to guarantee that I'll return your assets

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.100
all of them.

00:09:24.623 --> 00:09:26.224
Thank you so much.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.641
Pin?

00:09:54.663 --> 00:09:55.664
Sanya.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.600
Have you seen Sasin and Saenkaew?

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.520
I saw them walking

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.840
but I don't know

00:10:08.493 --> 00:10:10.000
where they were heading to.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.160
Is something bothering you?

00:10:39.177 --> 00:10:42.240
Maybe it's just all in my head.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.240
Whatever it is bothering you,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.041
you can talk to me.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.200
I know that I don't look reliable,

00:10:59.503 --> 00:11:01.680
but I'm happy to listen to you.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.221
Well,

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.040
I was really happy when

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.320
I was around Sasin and Saenkaew.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.760
We always hung out together.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.761
But now, it seems like
they're getting closer.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.160
I don't know.

00:11:30.503 --> 00:11:33.080
I can't help it but feel left out.

00:11:33.711 --> 00:11:35.831
It's like they don't see me anymore.

00:11:41.683 --> 00:11:44.200
I understand how you feel.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.600
But don't dwell on it.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.400
It's better for them to get closer,
rather than being mad, right?

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.883
You will marry Prince Saenkaew soon,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.640
after that

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.400
nobody will be closer to him than you.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.760
Thank you, Sanya.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.520
You've always been so kind to me.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.960
I'll keep your words in my mind.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.721
Sure.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.251
Right,

00:12:38.128 --> 00:12:40.728
Prince Bodin will take us to
have lunch with Ms. Tararat tomorrow.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.240
I think I can sneak out
during the gathering.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.920
I'll wait for you and take
you to see Ms. Rachawadee.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.240
Don't forget the certificate from the embassy.

00:12:53.712 --> 00:12:55.712
You need that for the marriage
certificate, don't you?

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.040
I don't know how Pin would react.

00:13:16.517 --> 00:13:18.518
I'll explain it all to her.
She will understand.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.481
Don't worry.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.160
Finally, I met someone who would

00:13:36.223 --> 00:13:38.240
pin a flirty guy like you down.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.700
- It's not like that. We…
- It's fine.

00:13:43.201 --> 00:13:46.240
I've been through a lot and
I've seen so many things.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.770
I'm happy for both of you.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.200
After this, your lives won't get easier.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.480
Someone will dislike you

00:14:04.023 --> 00:14:05.681
and someone will judge you.

00:14:07.983 --> 00:14:09.440
I need you to remember

00:14:12.217 --> 00:14:13.640
that you will get through this

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.481
with your love

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.024
and understanding.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.151
Thank you.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.320
Where have you been? I didn't see you.

00:14:59.577 --> 00:15:01.280
You left me here all alone.

00:15:05.378 --> 00:15:06.900
You want to dance with me?

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.681
Sasin,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.640
let me get you a drink.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.120
My dad told Kamsu to watch me closely.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.040
It's hard for me to get out of the house.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.280
But Prince Bodin will take Pin and I

00:17:00.361 --> 00:17:02.100
to have lunch with Ms. Tararat tomorrow.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.080
I think we should take this chance

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.600
and get a marriage certificate
with Ms. Rachawadee.

00:17:26.483 --> 00:17:28.800
Tararat doesn't meet people quite often.

00:17:29.123 --> 00:17:30.840
She is so kind

00:17:31.143 --> 00:17:33.160
for having lunch with us.

00:17:35.163 --> 00:17:37.360
Did you get her gift already?

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.400
It's in the car.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.360
It's getting late and nobody is ready?

00:17:49.297 --> 00:17:50.298
This is my document.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.631
I'll leave it to you.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.160
I'll pick up Ms. Rachawadee
and drop her off in Bangrak.

00:17:57.477 --> 00:17:58.717
Then I'll come back to get you.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.921
Saenkaew?

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.840
There you are.

00:18:10.161 --> 00:18:12.001
Let's go, my dad asked
me to come and get you.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.301
[Certificate of No Impediment]

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.261
Hello.

00:18:55.057 --> 00:18:57.888
You two look like a perfect couple.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.120
Like you're meant for each other.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.800
You need to have children
for your dad to play with soon.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.920
And so do you.

00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:09.898
Yes, ma'am.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.520
Excuse me,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.800
I'd like you to try this one.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.160
It tastes so good.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.600
I picked it especially for you.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.360
Bangrak District Office.

00:19:40.123 --> 00:19:42.600
Please wait here, I'll
need to pick up Saenkaew.

00:19:42.917 --> 00:19:43.918
Sure.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.440
Cheers to the future bride and groom.

00:20:08.623 --> 00:20:09.624
Cheers!

00:20:31.337 --> 00:20:35.440
- They said that Shumai here is so good.
- Pin, honey

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.600
why don't you get that dish for Saenkaew?

00:20:45.857 --> 00:20:47.288
That's Kamfah and his clan.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.681
I guess he is inviting
someone to a wedding.

00:21:14.183 --> 00:21:16.000
We can drop you off.

00:21:16.423 --> 00:21:18.320
No worries, my driver is waiting for me.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.160
Let me walk you to your car.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.201
Wait, dad.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.081
What is it?

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.840
I lost my watch.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.720
I guess I forget it in a bathroom
while I washed my hands.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.000
Can I go get it?

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.481
Well, Grandma can join me in my car.

00:21:52.681 --> 00:21:54.560
So you can get home earlier and rest.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.480
Pin, you can ride with Saenkaew.

00:21:57.721 --> 00:21:58.622
Okay.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.681
This way.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.680
We will be right back.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.560
Or Saenkaew could've dropped his watch

00:22:32.623 --> 00:22:34.480
while he walked with me in the garden.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.481
I think I should help him look.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.091
Saenkaew.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.740
What're you doing? Someone could see us.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.320
I missed you. Everything
is about to end now.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.721
Let's go or we won't make it.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.051
My dear Dongkamol,

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.960
why did he hug your future
bride's cousin like that?

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.760
He's been gone for too long.
Is something happened to him?

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.400
- Kamsu, check on him.
- Yes, sir.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.481
Prince Saenkaew?

00:24:27.363 --> 00:24:28.364
Sir?

00:24:33.717 --> 00:24:34.718
Sir,

00:24:36.143 --> 00:24:38.320
he is riding with Mr. Sasin out of here.

00:24:43.023 --> 00:24:44.680
Saenkaew is going somewhere with Sasin?

00:24:59.637 --> 00:25:02.638
I need to find a parking lot,
you need to see Ms. Rachawadee inside.

00:25:03.165 --> 00:25:04.166
They're about to close.

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:05.904
Okay.

00:25:12.337 --> 00:25:13.400
Hey,

00:25:15.377 --> 00:25:16.880
hey!

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.240
This is your document.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.091
- Thanks.
- I'll be right back.

00:25:40.683 --> 00:25:41.684
Prince Saenkaew.

00:25:57.317 --> 00:25:58.318
Dad?

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.641
What're you doing here?

00:26:10.437 --> 00:26:11.438
Go home!

00:26:12.823 --> 00:26:13.824
Prince Saenkaew?

00:26:25.723 --> 00:26:27.724
Saenkaew!

00:26:28.203 --> 00:26:30.040
- Saenkaew!
- Sasin.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.520
His dad dragged him out of here.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.520
How did Prince Kamfah
find out about us here?

00:26:50.032 --> 00:26:51.141
What do you think you're doing?

00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:54.715
Why did you go to the district office?

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.640
Why did you need this
embassy's certificate for?

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.480
I just wanted to do the
best thing for all of us.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.001
What do you mean?

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.801
The best thing for Pin and I

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.080
is to not get married.

00:27:13.691 --> 00:27:15.548
Pin deserves a better man than me.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.400
She doesn't deserve
to live in hell with me.

00:27:21.002 --> 00:27:22.361
Why did you change so much?

00:27:25.684 --> 00:27:26.804
Is it because of Sasin?

00:27:27.641 --> 00:27:29.280
How dare you disobey my order?

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.080
You questioned how I could dare to do this.

00:27:41.543 --> 00:27:43.760
But I questioned why I
was so scared earlier.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.200
I didn't even do anything wrong. Go ahead!

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.613
Go ahead! Hit me!

00:27:51.837 --> 00:27:52.877
You can even kill me!

00:27:54.823 --> 00:27:56.480
You can kill me

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.761
but you can't change me.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.100
I've tried my whole life

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.000
and I still can't change who I am.

00:28:15.683 --> 00:28:16.920
Now I'm done.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.800
I quit running away from myself.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.080
I will live my life like I want to.

00:28:37.878 --> 00:28:38.879
This is weird.

00:28:39.531 --> 00:28:41.732
Why did Saenkaew hug him?

00:28:42.641 --> 00:28:46.560
Oh come on! They must
be happy about something.

00:28:47.043 --> 00:28:49.760
We can be surprised when
we see him hugging a woman.

00:28:51.083 --> 00:28:52.084
You're right.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.600
It's still weird.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.080
Saenkaew has never been rumored to
be with any woman, never.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.961
Why is that?

00:29:15.157 --> 00:29:16.158
Sasin?

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:19.883
What did you do at the district office?

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.641
Why didn't you tell me?

00:29:24.785 --> 00:29:27.842
Do you have any idea why
Prince Kamfah found out about us?

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.240
I told him.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.063
I heard you two talked this morning.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.921
I'll leave it to you.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.560
I'll pick up Ms. Rachawadee
and drop her off in Bangrak.

00:29:46.923 --> 00:29:48.163
Then I'll come back to get you.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.900
Saenkaew?

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.880
That's why he followed you there.

00:29:57.761 --> 00:29:59.960
I know where they are.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.361
I heard Saenkaew talked
to Sasin this morning

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.120
that they'd go to Bangrak District Office.

00:30:14.377 --> 00:30:16.777
Why did you tell him?
Everything was ruined.

00:30:16.877 --> 00:30:17.878
What was ruined?

00:30:19.534 --> 00:30:21.904
Why didn't you tell me anything? Why?

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.081
What did you two plan to do?

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.800
I'm trying to help Saenkaew

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.200
- and I'm trying to help you.
- Help me?

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.000
Help me with what? Just tell me!

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.480
I'll wait until everything is done

00:30:39.777 --> 00:30:42.520
- then I'll explain it to you later.
- You always say that!

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.640
Don't you feel anything
because I sure feel something.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.841
Why didn't you tell me anything lately?

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.040
You acted like I was someone else.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.961
It used to be just the three of us.

00:31:14.283 --> 00:31:16.120
Can you stop acting like this?

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.400
If you tell me, we can
figure the way out together.

00:31:24.803 --> 00:31:26.320
I love both of you.

00:31:29.363 --> 00:31:31.080
Can you not act like I'm someone else?

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:36.851
Please?

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.641
I'm sorry.

00:32:12.723 --> 00:32:15.080
Are you sure that you want to do this?

00:32:18.543 --> 00:32:19.680
Do I have a choice?

00:32:21.063 --> 00:32:22.600
Just handle it already.

00:32:23.263 --> 00:32:24.264
Go.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.601
See you tomorrow.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.520
Don't be late, you
almost ruined it tonight.

00:32:45.303 --> 00:32:46.304
Okay.

00:32:47.223 --> 00:32:48.320
Did you drive here?

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.920
Nope, I didn't bring my car.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:52.477
No money for gas.

00:32:54.137 --> 00:32:55.800
So pathetic.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.280
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.681
- Get home safe.
- See you.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.120
- We should go.
- Let's go.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.291
Sasin.

00:36:08.163 --> 00:36:09.164
Saenkaew.

00:36:11.257 --> 00:36:12.257
I love you.

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:38.240
My name means the moon, you know?

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.760
And you're a rabbit.

00:36:44.223 --> 00:36:47.440
Rabbit belongs to the moon, just like you.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.320
You belong to me forever.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.200
Help! Help!

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.520
Pin! Pin!

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.360
Open the door! Please open the door!

00:37:16.297 --> 00:37:19.480
Anyone, please open the door!

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.400
- Open the door!
- It's late! Who's here?

00:37:29.363 --> 00:37:30.364
Sanya?

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.080
What's going on?

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.240
Sasin got shot.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.321
Where is he? How is he?

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.722
I sent him to the hospital.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.880
I don't know his condition yet,
I rushed here to tell everyone.

00:37:50.237 --> 00:37:51.238
Sasin?

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.920
Let's get changed so we can go.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.320
Please come inside to wait.

00:37:57.823 --> 00:37:58.824
Okay.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.240
Everyone's ready? Let's go.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.963
Where's Saenkaew?

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.721
Not ready yet.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.600
Open! Come on!

00:38:33.923 --> 00:38:34.924
Open! Come on!

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.361
You all should go.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.520
I'll take him there later.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.231
We should get going.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.200
Open the door!

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:56.880
Open the door!

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.840
What're you trying to do?

00:39:19.943 --> 00:39:20.944
Let me go!

00:39:22.203 --> 00:39:23.205
Stop, right now!

00:39:26.204 --> 00:39:27.205
Saenkaew!

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:30.320
- Where do you think you're going?
- To see Sasin.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.781
He's not gonna die.

00:39:33.243 --> 00:39:34.600
It's far from his heart.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.700
How did you know about that?

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.680
Sanya didn't tell us

00:39:43.597 --> 00:39:44.760
where he got shot.

00:39:49.497 --> 00:39:50.498
Dad?

00:39:53.123 --> 00:39:54.320
Did you do it?

00:39:57.037 --> 00:39:58.321
Why did you do it?

00:39:59.963 --> 00:40:01.120
You're too stubborn.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.321
I tried to talk to you
nicely and you won't listen.

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:07.760
Why did you hurt him?
Why didn't you hurt me?

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.800
I would hurt you if you weren't my son.

00:40:15.097 --> 00:40:16.400
You need to stop daydreaming

00:40:17.063 --> 00:40:18.840
and coming back to reality already.

00:40:21.843 --> 00:40:23.241
Stop humiliating me.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.920
And think about our family's pride.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.381
All you care is your pride

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.440
and family's dignity.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.920
What about my life?

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.280
What about my happiness?

00:40:41.883 --> 00:40:43.081
Your happiness

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.800
is about to destroy your life.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.100
You think people would praise your love?

00:40:52.703 --> 00:40:53.900
You will be a clown

00:40:55.112 --> 00:40:56.893
and everyone will be laughing at you.

00:41:01.297 --> 00:41:02.298
What about you?

00:41:04.837 --> 00:41:06.880
Are you gonna judge me as well?

00:41:24.563 --> 00:41:26.040
I can't help but think

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.600
that I would be much
happier if I weren't your son.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.211
Saenkaew!

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.141
You can hate me all you want

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.720
but I won't let you walk the wrong path.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.840
I won't let you walk to hell either.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:49.440
Even if it's hell

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.120
and Sasin is waiting for me, then I'll go.

00:41:57.643 --> 00:42:01.240
One more step and I'll have
someone shoot him again.

00:42:02.563 --> 00:42:04.483
And I'll have them shoot
him to death this time.

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.400
One more step.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.921
Sasin?

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.440
How is he?

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.080
He's safe now.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.120
The doctor took the bullet out already.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.001
Sasin.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.101
God bless, my dear.

00:43:12.763 --> 00:43:13.764
Who shot him?

00:43:14.683 --> 00:43:16.360
Does he have any enemies?

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.880
No one. He has never been in a fight.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.641
Pin?

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.280
How's Sasin?

00:43:43.417 --> 00:43:44.920
He's safe now.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:56.560
Saenkaew.

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:00.520
He wakes up?

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.200
What did the doctor say?

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.700
He woke up already.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.701
The doctor wanted him to
stay in the hospital longer.

00:44:07.757 --> 00:44:09.600
If his wound isn't
inflamed, he could go home.

00:44:12.957 --> 00:44:14.680
If you're worried about him,

00:44:15.023 --> 00:44:17.680
I'm gonna see him this
afternoon, you want to join me?

00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:26.664
I don't think so.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.680
He's doing good now.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:33.600
Please take care of him.

00:44:58.223 --> 00:44:59.543
You didn't see the gunman's face?

00:45:06.963 --> 00:45:08.000
Who did it?

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.960
Why did they hate you so much

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.920
that they could try to kill you like this?

00:45:13.943 --> 00:45:17.200
You've never involved in any fight.

00:45:22.977 --> 00:45:24.640
Actually, I can think of someone.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.201
Who?

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:31.880
- Don't tell me that it's his…
- That's right.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.200
I think Prince Kamfah was behind this.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.240
He must have know about
my relationship with Saenkaew.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.760
What're you gonna do?

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.160
This is huge.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.480
He's aiming for your life.

00:45:50.937 --> 00:45:53.520
Even if I have to die, I
won't break up with him.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.160
If I have to stay alive
without him by my side,

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.720
it's no different than a dead man.

00:46:17.957 --> 00:46:20.640
You did it, didn't you? Why?

00:46:21.523 --> 00:46:23.480
He's just a distant cousin of the bride.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.800
If he was dead, they still
won't cancel the wedding.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:27.960
Nope.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.560
I didn't do anything.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:33.271
Wait.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.480
He was attacked on his way back,
around Nang Loeng Street.

00:46:39.843 --> 00:46:40.844
Nang Loeng Street?

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.321
Right?

00:46:45.717 --> 00:46:47.397
The gunshot that we heard the other night?

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.640
- Hey! Don't run!
- Honey, where should we go? Come on!

00:46:52.397 --> 00:46:53.477
I told you to stop running!

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.280
- They're coming! Where to go?!
- This way!

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.040
- Where are they?
- Let's look around, come on!

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.760
- Are they gone?
- They're all gone, honey.

00:47:27.983 --> 00:47:29.960
That's a relief. Let me catch my breath.

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.441
A relief? It's all because of you.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.240
Who told you to cheat a dealer?

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.723
I told you that there are
eyes everywhere in the casino.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.040
We're lucky we're alive.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.920
Stop whining already, my baby.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.440
Let's get going before they return.

00:47:47.457 --> 00:47:49.160
Honey!

00:47:49.223 --> 00:47:50.440
- Honey!
- My baby!

00:47:50.857 --> 00:47:54.000
I got shot!

00:47:54.103 --> 00:47:55.420
Honey!

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.720
What's the noise earlier?

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.640
Sounded like a gunshot to me.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.080
Let's hide, come on.

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:29.200
This way!

00:48:57.036 --> 00:48:58.240
That's Kamsu?

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.760
Kamfah's people?

00:49:05.803 --> 00:49:06.880
Why did he do that for?

00:49:08.443 --> 00:49:09.443
I know, right?

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.600
They're about to get married next week.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.240
Can you give Sasin this letter?

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.600
Don't let my dad see it.

00:49:25.603 --> 00:49:27.900
Why do you need to send a secret letter?

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:32.160
Why don't you go and see him with us?

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.681
I…

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:40.280
I can't.

00:49:45.263 --> 00:49:46.263
Or…

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:49.051
You

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:51.240
and Sasin?

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.241
Stop asking.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.400
Just give him the letter.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.440
Why is it turned out to be this way?

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.920
I'm sorry.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.320
Am I disappointed you?

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:28.680
Sir?

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.081
When you're with Sasin

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.760
are you happy?

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.800
He is my only happiness.

00:50:44.363 --> 00:50:46.840
I've never expected anything from you.

00:50:50.123 --> 00:50:52.040
I just wish

00:50:52.997 --> 00:50:56.440
for your happiness, that's all.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.560
But my dad found out about us.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.560
He is the one who hurt Sasin.

00:51:19.257 --> 00:51:20.400
What's that?

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:27.200
Oh my goodness,

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.720
my poor little prince.

00:51:56.350 --> 00:52:00.120
I'm happy to see you're getting better.

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:04.840
Thank you so much for coming.

00:52:08.617 --> 00:52:09.618
Well…

00:52:10.477 --> 00:52:11.680
how's Saenkaew?

00:52:13.397 --> 00:52:16.400
He's not feeling well so he can't be here.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.760
You need to get well soon.

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.480
My wedding is coming closer.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.920
You need to play in my
wedding like you promised.

00:52:37.183 --> 00:52:40.240
Did you remember the gunman?

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.760
So you can tell the police
and he will be punished.

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:53.920
It's so dark.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:56.320
I didn't prepare for it.

00:52:57.550 --> 00:52:58.640
I couldn't see anything.

00:52:59.477 --> 00:53:00.478
That's too bad.

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:11.017
He looks a little bit tired.

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.280
Should we let him rest
so he will recover soon?

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:19.120
That's good. I'll be back.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:22.800
I gotta go.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.650
My dear Sasin,

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.320
While I am writing this,

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.840
I really hope it can be just
a normal letter from lovers,

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.640
not a hidden letter,

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.800
not a letter full of
restrictions and limits.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.160
But we both know it
can't be that type of letter.

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:55.440
My dad forbids me from seeing you.

00:54:56.943 --> 00:54:58.880
But nobody can forbid me from loving you.

00:55:00.303 --> 00:55:03.481
I'm still here and I still love you.

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.000
If you feel like you're
tortured all by yourself,

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.440
please know that I feel the same.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.800
Please wait for me.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:29.640
I will wait for you and I won't give up.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.201
I won't let what we have

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.960
to end just because
others say that it's wrong.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:41.000
I'll find my way back to you,
no matter how hard the road is.

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.521
Please trust me

00:55:44.121 --> 00:55:45.920
like I've always trusted you.

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.720
We will be back together again.

00:55:50.397 --> 00:55:51.700
I promise.

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.481
Love you the most.

00:55:56.057 --> 00:55:57.360
Your Saenkaew.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.001
I'm sorry.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.440
Watch where you're going, okay?

00:57:12.857 --> 00:57:13.858
Nual!

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.121
My... Sasin.
