[Love Conspiracy]

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.600
[Adapted from Enhenzhai's novel,
Madam, No Mercy for Scum]

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.500
[Episode 22]

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.700
I'm here to warn Zhizhi to be careful
of the people around her.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.860
What is going on here?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.020
Zhizhi,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.340
this was sudden.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.780
Let me explain everything later.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.580
Zhizhi,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.260
this isn't Ziming's fault.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.340
I asked him

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.260
to keep it secret.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.860
Ziming

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.020
will be the group's successor.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.620
You know
about the internal power struggles,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.420
don't you?

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.020
I'm just clearing the path for him.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.740
Mr. Ye,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.380
you surely know how to strategize.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.860
If we secure the agency rights
for Drizzt this time,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.180
according to our agreement,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.020
it'll be a win-win situation.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.660
You and Ziming grew up together.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.740
You're close.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.780
Once he takes over,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.580
I'm sure the collaboration
between you two

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.180
will be successful.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.940
So

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.420
I should thank you. Is that it?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.340
When we talk
about the people around her,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.220
you, the one set to marry her,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.300
are that person.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.460
You should be more concerned

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.500
who the people around you really are.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.660
What do you mean by that?

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.820
Don't you know what I mean?

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.380
Then I'll be blunt.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.180
You are not Ji Baijian!

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.460
You've been living under his name

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.620
all these years.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.420
So who are you really?

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.740
Since everyone's here, why don't you

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.660
explain everything?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.500
Cat got your tongue?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.900
Mr. Ye,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.140
I planned to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.740
show you this document
after the meeting.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.220
But since Mr. Ji is here,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.420
let's all

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.140
get reacquainted with Ji Baijian.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.260
This report

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.300
contains an DNA analysis comparing

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.660
the Ji Baijian from eight years ago

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.980
with the man standing before us.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.120
[Regarding the Paternity Relationship
Between Ji Baijian and Ji Yunlei]

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.340
He shares no blood relation
with Ji Yunlei.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.460
So who are you?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.780
This is strange.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.820
Wei Ziming, what does this
have to do with you?

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.260
You investigated me?

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.420
Tit for tat.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.180
You investigated me too, didn't you?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.300
Ji Baijian.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.100
May I call you that?

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.820
Nice move.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.980
I won't disturb your meeting.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.580
I'm leaving.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.340
Zhizhi.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.620
Zhizhi!

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.020
Ziming!

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.140
I'll take this opportunity

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.100
to introduce you to everyone.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.220
They'll support your work better.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.900
Come on, have a seat.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.620
No.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.500
Let's discuss this another day.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.860
Wait...

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.540
Let's end the meeting here.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.780
Everyone can leave now.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.820
Ziming, I called out

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.780
for your own good.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.740
Do you have any idea

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.980
how I've felt

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.180
since learning you're my son?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.220
Think about it.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.380
What kind of father
wouldn't help his son?

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.060
Everything I've done

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.980
is to secure your position

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.100
within the group.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.180
I'm clearing the path for you.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.220
I did this not just for the group,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.260
but for Zhizhi.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.580
Kid,

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.340
haven't you heard the saying

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.420
"Great achievers
don't fuss over minor details"?

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.460
A real man

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.380
can't afford

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.140
to be swayed
by these romantic sentiments.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.140
When did you start
investigating Ji Baijian?

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.500
Who is he, really?

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.060
A while ago.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.660
Something made me suspicious,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.340
so I looked into him.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.700
Is it

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.780
related to Ji Baijian?

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.580
Regarding the photo you asked me
to look into last night,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.300
it's confirmed to be a photo
of Ye Xiaoting and his son.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.220
He might be your nephew,

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.780
Ye Shengheng.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.460
The fact that I adopted you

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.980
has been a secret all these years.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.900
And we kept this confidential

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.620
to assist the police

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.620
with Ye Xiaoting's case.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.460
How did Wei Ziming find out about it?

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.860
I think he must have noticed me

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.100
visiting my parents' graves

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.900
at the cemetery.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.220
Wei Ziming is quite sharp.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.540
I'll have Yin Qin keep digging into him.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.300
The timing and motive behind his mother

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.900
sending him to an orphanage

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.420
makes me feel suspicious.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.940
Wei Ziming

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.420
is Ye Taiting's son,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.340
yet he was sent to an orphanage

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.620
and raised by the Song family.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.900
His backstory

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.420
could be crucial

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.900
to obtaining criminal evidence

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.940
against Ye Taiting.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.420
But the rough gemstones incident
was too long ago.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.140
We can't do much
about Ye Taiting for now.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.420
My gut tells me

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.860
he was involved

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.140
in my parents' car crash.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.300
If we can connect Ye Taiting

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.820
to the crash through Wei Ziming,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.220
we might finally bring him to justice.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.380
It would bring my parents peace.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.820
But he knows your identity now.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.820
He'll make a move against you.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.500
You need to be careful.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:26.860
Don't worry.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.140
I've made the first move,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.820
and I never fight unprepared.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.780
So what's your plan?

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.620
Since my cover is blown,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.100
I'll catch Ye Taiting off guard.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.780
My father, Ye Xiaoting,

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.380
founded Starlight Group.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.940
Doesn't that entitle me

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.700
to be the successor of Starlight Group?

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:55.860
Good.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.900
Then I'll

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.020
cooperate with you.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.660
I'll stir up public opinion

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.100
about the rough gemstones incident.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:04.740
And we'll

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.340
point all fingers

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.380
at Ye Taiting.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.860
A two-pronged attack

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.020
should throw him off balance.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.780
You uselss fools!

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.420
You told me Ye Shengheng was missing!

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.140
That he'd been dead

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.300
for years!

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.060
And now?

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.460
He's been right under my nose

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.620
as Ji Baijian all this time!

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.460
And I was like a fool

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.500
and didn't notice at all!

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.460
Look what you've done!

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.220
Mr. Ye, please calm down.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.260
This is my fault.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.780
I wasn't cautious enough.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.700
I got tricked by Ji Yunlei.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.500
But now Ziming has found out the truth.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.180
We still have time to be on guard.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.380
Listen,

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.900
Ji Baijian

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:02.900
might be doing this

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.820
not just for the Ji family,

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.820
but also for his parents!

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.700
What are you doing here?

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.820
I need to ask you something.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.500
Go ahead.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.020
Are you Ji Baijian or someone else?

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.380
Who did I legally marry?

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.580
Why have you been hiding everything

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.900
from me and lying?

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.100
I don't even know who you are.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.860
Don't tear that up!

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.540
Ji Baijian,

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.540
you deceived me once,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.780
and I retaliated.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.660
I thought we were even.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.620
But I didn't know

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.620
even your identity was fake
when we married.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.700
How much else have you been lying about?

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.900
Right now, I am Ji Baijian.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.380
I'm not lying.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.060
Ji Yunlei has legal adoption papers.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.100
Adoption papers?

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.660
Ji Yunlei adopted you.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.300
Then who were you originally?

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.340
Tell me,

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.700
who are you?

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.940
Before I became Ji Baijian,

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.220
I was Ye Shengheng.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.620
Ye Xiaoting's son.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.460
Why did you change from Ye Shengheng

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.620
to Ji Baijian?

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.580
How did you go
from being Ye Xiaoting's son

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.860
to Ji Yunlei's son?

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.700
The real Ji Baijian is dead.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.580
My real father was Ye Xiaoting,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.100
Ye Taiting's older brother.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.060
Twenty years ago,
our family was in a car crash.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.820
My parents died in that accident.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.620
I got saved by Ji Yunlei by chance.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.380
Mom! Dad!

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.380
Wake up!

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.340
Ye Shengheng!

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.740
Ye Shengheng!

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.280
Ye Shengheng!

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.740
Mrs. Ye.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.580
Xiaoting. Xiaoting!

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.620
He had me undergo the surgery

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.820
and kept me protected abroad.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.140
Be careful not to get it wet.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.980
Keep your diet light.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.900
Alright. Thank you.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.620
Alright.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.780
You do look like my son Baijian.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.380
Kid,

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.300
the accident damaged your face.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.260
The doctors performed
reconstructive surgery.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.180
You might look a little different now.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.380
It'll take some getting used to.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.220
This isn't me.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.540
This isn't me.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.900
This isn't me at all!

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.220
It's not me!

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.540
This isn't me!

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.260
Where are my mom and dad?

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.300
Where did they go?

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.020
They're dead!

00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.820
From now on,

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.300
I am your dad.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.620
You are my son.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.340
Your name is Ji Baijian.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.820
You must avenge your parents.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.140
Remember?

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.300
From then on,
I was no longer Ye Shengheng.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.300
I became Ji Yunlei's son, Ji Baijian.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.220
I gained a father's love,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.540
but I was also burdened with his hatred.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.620
So I promised him

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.700
I would avenge his wife.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:53.940
Zhizhi,

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.820
I never told you any of this

00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.580
because

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.500
it's my deepest shame.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.060
Haven't you always asked
who I really am?

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.780

So all these years,

Ji Baijian carried the mystery
of his past

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.700
and the hatred for his parents' deaths.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.820
He endured so much suffering
I never knew about.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.660
It must have been really tough
and lonely for him all these years.

Zhizhi.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.540

Okay.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:48.860
Then tell me,

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.020
when did you and Ye Taiting
acknowledge each other?

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.820
A while ago.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.460
That long ago.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.620
Then why didn't you tell me?

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.140
Nothing to tell.

It's not something to be proud of.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.340
Then

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.340
why did you help him?

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.220
I wasn't helping him.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.860
I was helping myself.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.060
You collaborated with Ji Baijian

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.380
on the Drizzt project

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.500
without telling me either.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.260
Zhizhi.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.060
Haven't you sensed

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.820
my feelings for you at all?

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.420
Ever since I came to the Song family,

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.660
you were the closest person to me.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.980
Then I've developed feelings
for you over time.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.660
But I knew I was beneath you.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.460
So I buried my feelings.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.140
But by the time I found the courage

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.420
to stand before you,

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.620
you'd already fallen for Ji Baijian!

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.740
I thought once you knew what he'd done,

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.940
you'd leave him.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.020
I thought if I had done well enough,

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.020
you'd finally see me.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:25.980
But you?

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.980
You're still entangled with him! Why?

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.860
Why is he the only one

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.740
who can affect you like this,

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.020
and not me?

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.260
What does he have that I don't?

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.260
Ziming,

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.180
it's not about who has more or less.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.180
We grew up together.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.700
I see you as a brother.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.260
I...

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.380
Brother?

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.980
I thought about protecting you

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.100
for a lifetime as your brother.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.860
But not anymore.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.340
Why does Ji Baijian get to have you,

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.580
and I don't?

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.140
Ziming.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.180
You're frightening me right now.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.900
It was my weakness
that made me lose you.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.020
Not anymore.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.300

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.180

Ziming,

I want to hold a party tomorrow.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.980
I'm going to let everyone know
that you're my son.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.780
Understood.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.540
I'll get ready.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:32.820
Also,

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.460
I'd like to

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.580
talk with you
about some internal matters

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.460
to prepare you
for joining the higher-ups.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:42.700
By the way,

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.580
don't sign that second contract

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.660
Song Zhizhi gave you.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.300
It's a trap.

You're sharp, Ziming.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.140
Whatever you say.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.100
I have one request.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.820
Name it. I'll agree to whatever you say.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.900
I want to return to Starlight Jewelry.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.140
Ms. Song, please take a look.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.140
I think the color gradient
on these two pieces

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.220
should be similar to
the ones over here.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.300
We just need to adjust this part.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:28.820
Alright.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.700
Ms. Song, Mr. Wei is here.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:40.980
What are you doing here?

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.380
Mr. Wei has recently received
an appointment from the group.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.100
As the special commissioner,

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.700
Mr. Wei will specifically assist
and handle

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.340
all major matters at Starlight Jewelry.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.860
From now on, all personnel changes
and major decisions

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.460
at Starlight Jewelry

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.780
will need his approval and oversight.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:00.780
Special commissioner?

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.420
If I recall correctly,

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.500
Starlight Jewelry is primarily
controlled by the Song family.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.580
Since when do we
need a special commissioner

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.740
coming in to dictate terms?

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.820
Times have changed.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.860
Starlight Jewelry
needs the group's backing

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.860
if you're going to bid
for the Drizzt project.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.500
Since the group is providing substantial

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.860
funding and resources,

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.220
it will supervise the daily management

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.940
of Starlight Jewelry.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.300
Looking forward to working together.

[Invitation to Starlight Group Party]

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.260
What's this?

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.180
An internal party of Starlight Group.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.060
Tonight, Ye Taiting will announce

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.420
that I am his son.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.620
So you stabbed me in the back

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.820
because you found out

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.820
Ye Taiting is your father. Is that it?

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.740
If I'm not mistaken,

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.460
my failed contract with Ye Taiting

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.180
was also your doing, wasn't it?

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.460
It's only natural

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.660
I'd warn my father against signing

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.540
a risky contract.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.500
But Zhizhi,

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.140
I told you I'd protect you.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.140
That promise still stands.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.780
If you're with me,

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.980
Starlight Jewelry will always be yours.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.180
But if you're still acting
like you were yesterday,

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.460
then I'll handle everything

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.100
