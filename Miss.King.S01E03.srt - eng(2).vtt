00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.234
Are you an idiot?

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:27.861
Badge of honor--

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.904
I'm so sorry you had to bring him here!

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:31.364
No worries.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.699
Thank you.

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:35.827
Well, then…

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:41.291
You're not qualified
to play against Shoichi Yuuki.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.377
Qualified?

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:47.130
Sit.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.136
Go ahead.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.596
Excuse me.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.766
Reiko, bring us drinks.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.646
Ouch! What was that for?!

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.566
Stop bossing me around, freeloader.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.200
To play against Shoichi Yuuki,
one must be a kishi.

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:16.576
Then, I'll become a kishi.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.244
It's not that easy.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:19.454
What?

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:23.500
To be a kishi,
you need to train at the Shoreikai.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.586
You must perform
to certain standards and climb the ranks.

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:28.087
SHOREIKAI: KISHI TRAINING INSTITUTION

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:33.134
Additionally, only four make it
up the ranks to become a kishi each year.

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:34.719
Besides that…

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:38.264
You have to be the
very first female kishi ever.

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:45.396
But isn't there a female kishi
who's active right now?

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:49.359
Here.

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:51.945
Like her.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.906
Oh, that's Yuna Hayami.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.034
She's not a kishi. She's a joryu kishi.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.828
Aren't they the same?

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.914
Joryu kishi, a female pro,
and kishi, a male pro, are different.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.625
There has never been a female kishi.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:07.377
Whoa, isn't that discrimination?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.797
No, there are women in the Shoreikai.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.716
But so far, no woman could become a kishi.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.095
In the 100 years since
the shogi association began,

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.180
there's been no female kishi.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.809
Plus, they also have an age limit.

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:25.436
What's the cutoff?

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.022
Twenty-six.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.443
At twenty-six,
you're kicked out of the Shoreikai.

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:36.156
Which means, you're already…

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.201
out of time.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.123
Does that mean…

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.508
No, there's another way.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:59.345
As an amateur, you can become
a kishi through the kishi admission test.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.139
KISHI ADMISSION TEST

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:05.226
If you rank high in amateur tournaments,
you qualify for pro matches.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.274
If you win over ten official pro matches
with a rate of 65 percent or higher,

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.526
you can take the kishi admission test.

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.779
In the test,
you'll play five games with kishi.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:20.617
If you win over three, you become a kishi.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.328
So, I just need to keep winning?

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:26.706
That's right. Just don't lose.

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.083
Reiko, hand me that flyer.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.668
Oh, this?

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:35.548
AMATEUR GYOKUSHO MATCH

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.720
But you can't go in unprepared.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.431
Play a match with me.

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:49.103
-Whoa!
-No, thanks.

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:53.191
Hey, wait! Are you even listening to me?

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.449
YUUKI

00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:03.785
She told me to quit shogi.

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:07.205
-Your mother.
-Oh.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.668
She'd let me marry you on that condition.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.677
Listen to me.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.182
What's the big deal?

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:28.434
Just quit.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:30.812
What?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.359
I mean, think about it.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:41.030
It's not easy to keep playing shogi
in a world full of men.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:48.746
Besides, "First-Ever Female Kishi"
is just a nice trophy title right?

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:53.251
But that title will stay in history!

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:56.212
Forever.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:13.021
Hey, your parents
might be home any minute…

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:16.274
I…

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.943
Yuna, I…

00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:24.615
I don't want you to live a hellish life.

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:47.346
AMATEUR GYOKUSHO MATCH TOKYO PRELIMINARY

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.520
A woman?

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.731
That's rare.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.218
I lost?

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:19.856
Miss, you're not bad for a beginner.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:22.900
For example, this move--

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.707
Oh! Hi, Asuka.

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.045
Tell me.

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:45.840
What?

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.135
Why did I lose?

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.473
Why you lost?

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.308
You don't get it, do you?

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.394
You thought you were good?

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.480
Don't underestimate shogi.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:01.981
How long since you last played?

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:07.236
Twenty years at least.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.700
And you thought
you'd just walk in and win?

00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:14.243
But on that day…

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:27.924
ROOK

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.467
That was just a fluke.

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.678
Don't underestimate shogi or kishi.

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:36.307
Shogi is a way of life for kishi.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.059
It goes beyond the board.

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:42.813
Sit down.

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:01.749
Do you think you can beat me?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.803
I'm not trying to win now.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.346
What?

00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:36.576
I lost again!

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:41.247
You're weak. You lack everything.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.374
You could never kill Shoichi Yuuki.

00:09:47.795 --> 00:09:51.424
Ever wondered why
Shoichi left you and your mother?

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:56.596
Maybe because you were so worthless!

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.055
What?!

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.181
Hey, Seigo.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:03.102
What a fraud you are.

00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:20.745
Disappeared?

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.079
Yeah. Gone.

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:24.832
Asuka Kunimi is gone.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.722
Make yourself at home.

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:41.724
Are you sure?

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:44.018
You have nowhere to go, right?

00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:47.021
Well…

00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:50.274
One more freeloader won't change a thing.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:03.954
Thank you so much.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.260
Ever wondered why
Shoichi left you and your mother?

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:22.223
Maybe because you were so worthless!

00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:25.393
Don't touch my shogi set!

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:28.687
Leave me alone, will you?

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.147
I must win.

00:11:31.565 --> 00:11:33.943
You should stop playing shogi.

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.904
It'll be okay now.

00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:39.156
Asuka,

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:43.244
don't be like me.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.789
Be free and live your life.

00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:16.861
What's up?

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:18.988
I couldn't sleep.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:22.908
I see.

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.501
Did you come over to help?

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:34.670
Yeah.

00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:37.882
Okay, then.
Could you clean the tables with this?

00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:38.841
Sure.

00:13:04.992 --> 00:13:06.494
You've frozen.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:09.622
Sorry.

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:18.172
Seigo told me about your situation.

00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:25.095
I'm so sorry about your mother.

00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:28.057
It must've been hard.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:31.352
No…

00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:35.481
Seigo was awful, wasn't he?

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.652
You're still processing
the loss of your mother.

00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:41.946
Revenge and killing?

00:13:43.113 --> 00:13:47.076
And calling you weak?
You can only handle so much at once.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.079
He really lacks emotional intelligence.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.335
But I think…

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.422
he's serious in his own way.

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:05.636
It's been so long since
he last brought out the shogi set.

00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:09.640
He's been through a lot
and couldn't play for a while.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:26.740
Breakfast! Hey, wake up!

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:30.077
Ouch, it hurts! Don't be so rough!

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.662
I said breakfast!

00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:34.373
I don't want it. I'm hungover--

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:42.006
I'm a freeloader too.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.774
You still get hungry
after a bad loss, huh?

00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:02.276
Ouch!

00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:03.319
Stop talking.

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:04.904
I'm sorry.

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:08.073
This miso soup is so delicious.

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.909
Asuka made it.

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:10.951
What?

00:15:11.952 --> 00:15:15.581
My mother taught me
when she was still alive.

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:19.418
Oh, okay. I see.

00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:23.005
Yeah. It's good.

00:15:32.973 --> 00:15:33.974
What?

00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:43.317
Mr. Todou, about what you said last night…

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.236
I have absolutely no idea.

00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:50.574
The reason that man left me and my mother.

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.828
I thought about it, over and over.

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:57.539
But it pissed me off.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:01.919
It pissed me off, so I wanted to kill him.

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:04.672
I see. Good for you.

00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:07.341
-What?
-What's good about it?

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:11.387
To play shogi, you need an opponent.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.223
You play against a human being.
Remember that.

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:18.477
You face them even when you don't want to.

00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:23.899
And don't ever run
from your own weakness either.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.489
All right. Let's go.

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.576
In return for your miso soup.

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:39.832
Thank your mother
for teaching you this recipe.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:42.876
Come on.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.211
What?

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:50.217
Sorry. Thank you for the food.

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:04.231
Hello, there!

00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:05.149
Hi!

00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:06.191
Oh, you're here.

00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:07.693
-Hello.
-Hi!

00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:11.655
Hi, Mr. Todou! Good time yesterday.

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:15.242
Hi, Mr. Sankichi.
She's the one I told you about yesterday.

00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:17.995
The lion cub.

00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:21.957
Oh, really. She's the one. I see.

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:31.425
BEGINNER FRIENDLY
ICHIGEKI SHOGI CLUB

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:04.041
This bishop is mine!

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:10.714
I win, don't I?

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.010
You lost.

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:23.519
Miss, you handle your pieces
pretty rough, don't you?

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:30.984
At the end of a shogi game,
you have a post-game analysis,

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:34.071
where you review
and evaluate each other's moves.

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:35.447
Don't run away.

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:42.996
Come to this pit everyday
and play shogi to death.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.167
Well, Mr. Sankichi. Take care of her.

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.627
I sure will.

00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:59.221
Yesterday, the association reached out.

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:02.391
They want you to be the next chairman.

00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:06.436
Of course,
I'll handle the practical matters.

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:10.983
All you need to do is sit in the chair.

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:17.823
I know you've always dreamed of us
standing at the top of the shogi world.

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.117
That's right.

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:28.500
But as things stand now, that may
quickly end with Shoichi's generation.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.097
Here's your drink. Enjoy.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.226
Asuka, you're home!

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.895
I'm home.

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:50.230
So, how many wins?

00:19:50.814 --> 00:19:52.065
Two.

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:55.235
Wow, Asuka! That's amazing.

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:57.571
And how many losses?

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:02.242
Thirty-nine.

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:04.119
What?

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.750
We have the Amateur Meioh Match next week.

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:12.628
If you lose here, give up on your revenge.

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.047
Next week? That's impossible.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.049
Shut up, Reiko!

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:20.969
We're going for the impossible here.

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:49.915
I resign.

00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:05.555
It was this move here…

00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:14.189
I resign.

00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:34.960
Ah.

00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:36.295
Nice.

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:38.046
I resign.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.215
-That was close.
-Very close.

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:43.051
I really thought
you might win until the mid-game.

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:44.011
Right?

00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:48.390
You need to know
when to attack and when to hold back.

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:50.600
Your judgment was a bit off, you know?

00:21:51.351 --> 00:21:53.228
-That's true.
-Patience is crucial.

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.355
-That's right.
-She did well.

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:56.898
You've gotten much better.

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.483
-Yeah.
-I agree.

00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:08.952
AMATEUR MEIOH MATCH

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:15.334
Sorry!

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:16.585
Took you long enough!

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.045
I said sorry!

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:24.718
What's with that outfit?

00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:28.472
Ms. Reiko suggested I change.

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:29.473
What can I say?

00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:33.268
I felt bad watching her hunched over
the board like a rag every day.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.980
Can't she look decent
for a match at least?

00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:38.774
Stop pitying her.

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:42.027
Attention everyone,
the opening ceremony is about to begin.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:44.780
Okay!

00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:54.247
As we open the tournament today,
I'd like to welcome a wonderful guest.

00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:56.583
Yuna Hayami, joryu 3-dan!

00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:59.127
Yuna!

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:02.422
THE 32ND AMATEUR MEIOH MATCH TOKYO

00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:05.383
Hello, everyone. I'm Yuna Hayami.

00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:09.471
-Wow.
-Yuna!

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:12.891
You're still popular as ever!

00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:14.392
What is she, an idol?

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:18.396
Well, Hayami joryu 3-dan, may we ask you
to officially open the tournament.

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:24.319
Certainly! I hereby declare
the opening of Amateur Meioh Match!

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.923
Oh, it's you again.

00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:53.140
Too bad for you. I'll beat you again.

00:23:59.729 --> 00:24:03.942
FIRST ROUND

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.719
No way…

00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:17.557
I resign.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.277
You jumped your knight here.

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:32.364
But you could've defended
the third file with the rook.

00:25:32.447 --> 00:25:35.867
Hey, how did she get so good
all of a sudden?

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:45.126
Staying out late?
You have a big tournament tomorrow.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.504
When I said today might be my last day,

00:25:47.587 --> 00:25:50.757
the grandpas decided
to throw a farewell party.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.136
They asked me to visit and shook my hands.

00:25:56.012 --> 00:25:58.473
I see. That's nice.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.270
So, did you figure out your weakness?

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.480
Yes.

00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:08.692
You tend to rush to win.

00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:12.904
On the contrary,
many strategies aim for not losing.

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:15.282
That's what opening theory is for.

00:26:15.365 --> 00:26:18.410
A player like you,
who goes straight for the king,

00:26:18.493 --> 00:26:20.287
can be vulnerable against that.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.164
Like I said,
shogi is a way of life. I'm saying--

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:25.250
Is this going to take a while?

00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:26.376
What?

00:26:26.459 --> 00:26:28.503
I want you to apologize first.

00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:31.715
Even though my mother and I
did nothing wrong,

00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:35.969
you forced me to understand
why that man left us.

00:26:36.052 --> 00:26:37.304
That was awful.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.685
Well, how many games today?

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.521
Forty-two.

00:26:47.897 --> 00:26:49.024
How was it?

00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:52.694
I don't think I have…

00:26:55.238 --> 00:26:57.240
anything left to learn there.

00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:04.497
I see.

00:27:04.581 --> 00:27:07.250
You can only go so far
with talent alone, huh?

00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:08.752
So,

00:27:08.835 --> 00:27:09.919
did you apologize?

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.631
That helped her! It's harsh medicine.

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.134
You're awful.

00:27:19.512 --> 00:27:22.974
SECOND ROUND

00:27:35.695 --> 00:27:36.613
I resign.

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:41.368
AMATEUR MEIOH MATCH A-CLASS

00:27:41.951 --> 00:27:45.163
THIRD ROUND

00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:03.848
SEMIFINAL

00:28:17.987 --> 00:28:19.406
I resign.

00:28:29.624 --> 00:28:31.251
Still haven't found her?

00:28:31.334 --> 00:28:34.045
The landlord and realtor
don't know her new address.

00:28:34.129 --> 00:28:35.588
Hurry and find her.

00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:44.222
Thank you for the match.

00:28:44.305 --> 00:28:45.807
Thank you.

00:28:56.776 --> 00:28:57.944
What a surprise.

00:28:58.778 --> 00:29:01.322
I didn't expect to find
such a talented woman here.

00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:07.454
But promoting the bishop here,

00:29:07.537 --> 00:29:10.999
if he'd moved silver to the third,
you would've been in trouble.

00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:17.255
It might've been better
to go with the gold.

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:24.554
But in that case…

00:29:27.056 --> 00:29:28.391
Gold…

00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:35.607
Silver. I'm blocked. Couldn't checkmate.

00:29:42.238 --> 00:29:43.406
Ms. Kunimi.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.328
Will you have a match with me sometime?

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:50.288
What?

00:29:54.083 --> 00:29:55.084
Sure.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.837
Sorry, Yuna.

00:29:59.547 --> 00:30:01.716
Tatsuya, I found someone interesting.

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:07.305
What? Do you know her?

00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:15.355
I assumed you hated shogi.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.151
You're even dressed for the occasion?

00:30:20.944 --> 00:30:23.404
What's gotten into you?

00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:25.990
None of your business.

00:30:26.074 --> 00:30:27.158
It totally is.

00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:30.870
Have you forgotten about the oath?

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.836
You must refrain from any action
that would cause possible harm to us.

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.295
So shogi is unacceptable--

00:30:41.965 --> 00:30:42.966
What?

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:45.760
What?!

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:54.644
Tastes like crap. What a waste of time.

00:30:54.727 --> 00:30:57.981
Were you still
hanging onto shogi, Master Todou?

00:30:58.064 --> 00:31:02.318
Spoiled boy stuck in C-Class
talking big, huh?

00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:03.945
That's not your business.

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:07.448
It totally is. Want to mess with her?
You go through me first.

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.242
She is my…

00:31:13.788 --> 00:31:15.081
What are you?

00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:17.208
Whatever.

00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:19.961
Just go away, C-Class boy!

00:31:20.795 --> 00:31:25.341
Go. Go away. Now. Beat it!

00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:27.343
Hey!

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.555
Good luck with the finals.

00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:41.441
FINAL

00:32:05.673 --> 00:32:06.716
Let's have a good game.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.509
Likewise.

00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:44.879
Hey, is she smiling?

00:32:46.255 --> 00:32:48.591
I've never seen her look like that.

00:32:50.426 --> 00:32:52.637
So, how is she doing?

00:32:53.554 --> 00:32:57.475
It's very close.
This is the crucial point.

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:19.580
ROOK

00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:26.671
Stop…

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:35.847
Stop playing shogi…

00:33:43.229 --> 00:33:44.397
Stop it.

00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:50.361
What's wrong?

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.451
Stop playing…

00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:03.875
Stop playing shogi…

00:34:30.777 --> 00:34:33.613
When I play shogi,
everyone ends up miserable.

00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:36.616
Cut that crap.
Try making me any more miserable.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:38.409
He punched Shoichi Yuuki.

00:34:38.493 --> 00:34:40.787
I'm quitting shogi.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:42.371
You talked Asuka into it.

00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:45.708
Weren't you going to team up
and kill Shoichi Yuuki with shogi?

00:34:45.792 --> 00:34:48.086
Why did you attack Shoichi Yuuki?

00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.297
My dad died.

00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:55.343
