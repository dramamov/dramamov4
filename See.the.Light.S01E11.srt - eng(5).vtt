WEBVTT

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.680
Sister.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.240
Why didn't we stop Hu Qiang just now?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.760
To protect Hu Li.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.840
Hu Li is the last belief and dignity

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.080
in this world.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.800
We can't stop it.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.480
nor take it away.

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.720
But...

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.520
Jin-kyung.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.080
It's okay.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.480
she met us, didn't she?

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.080
Boss.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.840
Someone asked me to give this to you.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.400
It's a gift for you.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.080
Where is he?

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.160
At the door.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.120
Let's go.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.120
You're her dad, right?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.280
You're...

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.520
Juan's sister, right?

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.680
Yes.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.840
Juan told me she had a fight with you today.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.280
She asked me to come here to apologize to you.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.360
Bah!

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.240
That girl.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.960
Is she that kind?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.920
What kind of apology does she have?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.120
I heard that Juan has a sister.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.560
She's really rich now.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.200
Living in a foreign house and a foreign car

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.880
Compared to the money Juan sold meat,

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.280
That's the big head.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.840
No wonder Juan was so generous that she had to pay for it.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.600
She found her way out.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.760
Juan.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.560
How could she tell me where Sumire is?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.360
You don't know.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.320
But Juan slipped my tongue today.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.640
A slip?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.160
What do you think?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.600
I think...

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.000
we can go to Sumire together.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.160
and see what money

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.600
from her foster parents.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.800
But I want this amount.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.400
My baby.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.400
Look at you.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.360
You're so pretty.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.680
Why is your heart so dark?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.360
You can't find anyone without me.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.720
I can't get money without you.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.920
Can her adoptive parents give us money?

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.840
She wouldn't have grown up without you.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.480
Yes, you're right.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.000
She eats my food.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.960
Drink mine.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.720
Spit it out!

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.640
Let's go get money.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.360
It's not time yet.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.360
What time?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.120
Now.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.800
Hu Juan.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.280
Hu Qiang

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.080
won't bother you and Hu Li anymore.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.400
Thank you.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.440
It's nothing.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.200
Pack up.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.960
We're going to meet Sumire

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.560
To see Sumire?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.920
Yes.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.960
Your sister

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.000
is really loyal.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.760
It makes sense that your foster parents

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.280
to treat you first

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.320
and find you a job.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.440
They'll take care of you from now on.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.680
Sumire's adoptive parents.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.800
Do you know what I do?

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.560
I know. It's okay.

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.360
They don't mind.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.360
A rich family.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.680
You can afford eight.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.720
Don't worry.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.400
I'll get ready.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.560
Okay, hurry up.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.400
Are you going to see my sister?

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.240
We'll be there soon.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.320
Great.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.040
I've talked to my parents.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.040
I'll take you home this time.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.640
we'll never be apart again.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.560
Don't cry.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.320
How can I see you if your eyes are swollen

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.040
Pretty

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.920
Take care of the house.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.880
Let's go.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.159
What does Sumire's adoptive parents do?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.440
I think they're in construction business.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.640
A decent Confucian.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.960
Sumire is still in school.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.040
She's in her senior year.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.320
She's going to study in Soviet Union next year.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.880
Soviet Union?

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.520
It's nice.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.080
Just so so.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200
Russian is hard to say.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.920
You have to tie your tongue.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.640
That's all. Are you done?

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.240
I'll go get changed.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.040
I've always been curious.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.200
Haven't you thought about

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200
to find each other?

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.880
It's okay.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.760
she found a rich family. How about...

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.520
Let's not talk about that.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:44.760
The most important thing now

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.800
you'll meet each other soon.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.280
You should think about

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.520
how to

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.560
to make up for the regret in the past?

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.680
and try to live a good life.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.360
Right?

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.080
Right?

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.280
Juan.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.720
Juan.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440
Juan, I'm coming in.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.680
It's not done yet.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.240
Juan.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.360
Juan.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:35.920
Chen Guodong, Li Bobo, Zhao Zihao.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.280
Zhang Chuan, Wang Zhiqiang, Ma Ming.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:39.800
Zhang, Jie, Zhou Wenjie, Gao, Yuan.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.080
Zhang Yikang, Hao Xin, Zhang MingGuan,
