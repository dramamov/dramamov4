00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.680
Your Majesty,

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.710
the First Prince has entered the palace.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:10.280
He's arrested Prime Minister Zhuang

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.280
and is heading to Changchun Palace.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.030
He arrested Zhuang Shen?

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.590
Yes.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:19.880
The elite troops of the Feng Battalion
assembled last night.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.290
Has he

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.960
led the Feng Battalion into the city?

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.790
No.

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.190
This morning, His Highness

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.070
went to the Zhuang Residence

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.230
with only a few dozen men.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.000
He was ambushed on Yongning Street.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.710
The head of the assassins was

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.670
Zhuang Ming, the Prime Minister's nephew.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.000
Zhuang Ming is now dead.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.620
His Highness came alone

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.230
with Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.800
Suige…

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.720
Is the First Prince injured?

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.980
He seems mostly fine,

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.300
but Prime Minister Zhuang is injured.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.620
He doesn't look good.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.470
Your Majesty,

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.400
Her Majesty and the Second Prince

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.660
are kneeling outside.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.260
Do you want them to leave?

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.700
Make Chengyang leave.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.480
What about Her Majesty?

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.630
This is her fate.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.840
She cannot avoid it.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:11.000
Yes.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.150
This day

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:18.960
has finally come.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:25.400
[Grace in Blessed Accord]

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:26.570
Second Prince.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.760
Let me go!

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.130
Forgive me, Your Highness.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.770
Please leave.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:34.480
This is His Majesty's order.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.400
With my mother here like this,

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.710
how could I possibly leave?

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:37.780
If Father is angry,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.530
I'm willing to be punished.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.480
Escort His Highness back.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.140
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.620
-Chengyang.
-Mother!

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.110
Father!

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:46.840
Eunuch Ma,

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.760
what is the meaning of this?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.760
Your Majesty,

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.920
His Majesty ordered this

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.580
to protect the Second Prince.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:55.000
Tell me,

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.170
has something happened?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.840
You'll know soon enough.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.200
My Lords,

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.110
when the First Prince
entered the palace earlier,

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.670
he instructed me
to wait here with a message.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:13.580
You shall all

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.800
go to the Changchun Palace.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.800
Please follow me.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.440
Hurry!

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.270
[Changchun Palace]

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:01.450
Stop her!

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.480
Father!

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.470
Father!

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.510
Let go of me!

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.630
Let go of me!

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.110
Father,

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.560
what happened?

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.760
Father!

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.190
Let me go!

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.840
Let…

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.150
Father!

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.400
Father!

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.440
I want to see my mother!

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.280
Mother!

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:24.800
Let go of me!

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.030
I want to see my mother!

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.880
Let go of me!

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.590
I want to see my mother!

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:32.780
Let go of me!

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.070
Let go of me!

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:36.330
I want to see my mother!

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.030
Mother!

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:40.070
Let go of me!

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.190
I want to see my mother!

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.380
Let go of me!

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.920
Mother!

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.320
I want to see my mother!

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.650
Let go of me!

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.920
I want to see my mother!

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.630
Mother!

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.590
Let go of me!

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.320
Mother!

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.420
Let go of me!

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.790
Father!

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:05.000
Let go…

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.660
Let go of me.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.890
Father.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:09.280
Father.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:10.400
Father,

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.860
what exactly happened?

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.590
Father!

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.360
Let me go!

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.040
Father!

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.230
[Grace in Blessed Accord]

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:21.490
Feng Suige,

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:22.880
what are you going to do?

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:24.190
This is the imperial palace.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:26.070
How dare you attack the Prime Minister?

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.670
Are you staging a rebellion?

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.820
It was at this place that you

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.410
killed my mother back then.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.660
Today, I'll make you pay for it

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.630
with your life here.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:42.530
Let go!

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:51.640
Your Majesty.

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.830
Your Majesty.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:56.910
Your Majesty,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.190
I beg for your mercy.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.440
Please save my father.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:03.840
No matter how grave his crimes,

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.150
he is still my father

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.360
and Chengyang's grandfather.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.360
I would rather die myself

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.150
than watch my father die.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:13.470
Your Majesty,

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:15.840
for the sake of the years

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.960
we spent as husband and wife,

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.630
please save him.

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.990
Your Majesty,

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.710
only you can

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:24.960
stop Feng Suige now.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.970
Your Majesty, have you agreed?

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.670
Empress.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.190
My condolences.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.150
What did you say?

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.630
Don't you remember?

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:04.590
15 years ago, right here,

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.510
I watched helplessly

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:08.900
as Qingyu died.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:10.840
The first thing

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.570
you said to me was

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.380
"My condolences."

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.640
Your Majesty,

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:30.600
my condolences.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.480
You're the Empress of Susha.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.760
How can you cry?

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:44.190
Your father schemed meticulously

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:45.320
to kill Qingyu

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.070
just so you could become empress.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.800
He's about to die now.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.000
This is the last time

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.670
he'll ever see his daughter.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.150
He should see

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.440
the dignified,

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.030
composed,

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.150
majestic
empress of the kingdom.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.510
Don't cry.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.510
Smile.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.150
Zhuang Shen.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.400
You should die here.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.880
You should die here!
