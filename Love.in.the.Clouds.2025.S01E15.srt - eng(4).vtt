We can't keep Ji Bozai under control,

Do you really think this act of yours will work?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.280
The more unpredictable our moves,

Ji Bozai's sudden visit

it was his companion beast.

his true cultivation stage,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.640
I didn't give away the existence of the Soul-Consuming Tree!

Ji Bozai was thrown out

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.520
if you were...

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.190
I only wanted

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.190
to avoid worsening my relationship with Ji Bozai.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.040
Otherwise, it would've been even harder to get things done.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.670
I have no ulterior motives.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.160
I ask for your discernment, Lord Hanfeng.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.190
Me too.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.000
I've spent so much effort on it,

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.160
but it seems this useless thing will never grow tall.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.520
I should pull it out.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.000
I know of a folk remedy

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.640
that might help this Hanqing Bamboo.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.280
You can heal plants too?

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.040
I will fetch the materials right away.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.830
Fetch the materials?

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.000
If I remember correctly,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.400
the key ingredient

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.520
in that remedy is teeth, isn't it?

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:30.400
Yes.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.160
Teeth...

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.710
ground into powder.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.120
I never said

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.000
I wanted your teeth.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.520
I'll do it myself.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.760
You are truly skilled in medicine.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.760
You even cured Sun Liao's foul mouth.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.520
Now, about caring for my brother,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.550
nothing will go wrong, right?

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.120
I will do my utmost, Your Lordship.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.920
That tree is definitely more than it seems.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.190
Mu Qibai loves plants,

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.880
but in his entire courtyard,

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.070
only that tree is thriving.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.160
It's as if it's draining all the others

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.640
to feed itself.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.640
The one I saw in Hou Zhao's memories

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.880
must have been that tree.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.790
It likely extends from the courtyard

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.360
into a hidden chamber underground.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.760
Its roots looked demonic.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.470
If it can drain other trees,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.160
it might

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.710
also consume primordial spirits.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.590
I once read

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.790
about an ancient technique from the Mangfu Swamp.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.550
It allows one to extract a person's primordial spirit

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.160
and bind it to a towering tree,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.640
turning the tree into a Soul-Consuming Tree.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.990
The air around it reeks of blood.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.320
Such trees can preserve primordial spirits

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.510
until someone uses them.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.710
Could this be the same method Xinliu mentioned

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.800
for breeding netherbeasts?

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.600
The best nourishment for a netherbeast

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.950
is the primordial spirit of a living being.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.990
A century ago, netherbeasts ravaged the realms,

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.950
devouring everyone in their path.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.750
Even the Spiritual Veins Fairies who raised them

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.080
were eaten alive.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.710
If Mu Qibai

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.080
gathers these beasts into an army,

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.950
there will be disastrous consequences.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.080
This is serious.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.990
We should report it to the Emperor of Jixing.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.880
The Emperor has long been under Mu Qibai's control,

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.510
trapped in slumber for years.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.950
He's no different from a puppet.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.190
Then maybe we should alert the other five realms.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.670
Those in power

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.670
are all the same.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.510
If they learn

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.160
of a netherbeast army,

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.120
they'll only want to claim it for themselves

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.750
and use it to dominate the Six Realms.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.600
Not all who hold power

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.840
are slaves to it.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:08.950
Some still care

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.710
for the lives of others.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.400
We should try to unite as many as we can.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.190
Unite?

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.080
That's impossible.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.670
But we're too few in number.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.710
Those netherbeasts are far too strong.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.600
If we fail

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.190
to stop Mu Qibai,

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:26.510
what will happen to the Six Realms?

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.030
You grew up safely in Yaoguang Palace,

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.160
receiving support from the Lower Realms for seven years.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.880
Naturally, you believe there are still

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.600
righteous people in the Six Realms.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.230
If you had spent even a single day in the Sunken Abyss,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.840
you would understand

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.750
how greedy and malicious people can be.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.080
If the netherbeast army is ever exposed,

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.270
before Mu Qibai even stirs up trouble,

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.360
the Six Realms will all fall into chaos over that power,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.360
and Yaoguang Mountain will be no exception.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.470
The fact

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.640
that you take no pride in your background

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.990
is already rare enough.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.120
So just being born in an Upper Realm

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.120
is already considered rare.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.880
Tianji has issued a decree.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.880
Starting today, the training is over.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.560
You no longer need to stay at Shouhua Academy.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:43.710
Head back now.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.800
I don't want this companion beast

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.840
to get into any more trouble while in my care.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:01.620
[Zhushui Spiritual State]

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.230
Greetings, Father.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.030
Chao Yu,

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.470
you've done well quelling the rebellion

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.470
in Cangwu Hill.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.120
Is there any reward you wish for?

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.600
[Chao Yu, First Prince of Zhushui]
It was only my duty. I wish for nothing.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.360
You deserve a reward.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.470
How about I grant you the title of Lord Jingxi?

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.360
That would be a great honor, Father.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:38.920
But truly,

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.080
all I wish is to help you...

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.750
By the way,

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.600
rumors have been spreading through the Judgment Hall

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.880
and the Medical Hall

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.750
[Chao Heng, Emperor of Zhushui]
that I intend to name you Crown Prince.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.670
Have you heard such talk?

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.080
Let me show you something.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.750
The tongues of those who spread the rumors are all inside.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.990
They... they brought this upon themselves.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.320
I'll ask you again.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.880
You deserve a reward.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.990
How about I grant you the title of Lord Jingxi?

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.840
Father, please believe me.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.160
I live only to serve and support you.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.560
I have no ulterior ambitions.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.950
Please believe me, Father!

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.920
Congratulations, My Lord,

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.230
on receiving the title of Lord Jingxi.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.080
Get lost!

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.400
Forgive me, My Lord.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.400
I thought you had

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.190
the Crown Prince's seat in the bag this time.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.670
But I just heard

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.600
that Father only gave you the title of Lord Jingxi

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.560
and even killed a few of your men.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.120
Did you come here to mock me?

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.160
I wouldn't dare.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.950
Father hasn't named a Crown Prince yet

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.190
because he has many sons

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.080
and wants to see who proves himself best.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.600
But I truly hope

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.360
[Chao Xuan, Second Prince of Zhushui]
you'll be the one named Crown Prince.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.230
What are you getting at?

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.560
Do you know

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.190
where Chao Yuan has been these past few months?

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.120
That good-for-nothing?

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.120
Where else could he go?

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.710
He heard

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.510
Jixing Abyss was refining medicine in the Sunken Abyss

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.160
and went to seek the Golden Millet Dream.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.400
What?

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.270
Yu, you were always kind to Chao Yuan growing up.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.400
But if he finds the Golden Millet Dream first

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.600
and brings it to Father,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.710
do you think

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.560
Father will allow him to cultivate spiritual veins?

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.880
That will be a great accomplishment.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.950
Do you think it will earn him

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.950
a chance at the Crown Prince's seat?

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.880
What?

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.120
That great man is coming to Jixing Abyss in person?

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:18.990
Yes.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.600
But since he's a warrior,

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.270
he cannot enter the realm.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.560
He specifically asked that Your Lordship go out to greet him

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:24.600
and escort him.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:39.750
Your Lordship.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.080
After all these days,

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.360
Mu Qibai has finally left Dragon Carp Terrace.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.080
Yes.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.470
He prepared a ship and a carriage.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:48.510
It seems he's going on a long journey.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.320
I placed the Tracking Seal Ming Yi made

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.600
on his vehicles.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.840
For the next 12 hours,

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.190
we'll be able to track his movements.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.190
Those little trinkets she's made

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.950
really do come in handy.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.840
Indeed.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.750
Earlier, as per your order,

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.640
I observed Twenty-Seven

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.950
near Dragon Carp Terrace.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.750
He was thorough in his search,

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.470
and I found nothing suspicious.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.160
As Ming Xian's companion beast,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.750
he's obedient to Ming Yi

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.950
probably because she shares a strong bond

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.400
with Ming Xian.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.400
Let's set off.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:34.400
Immortal Ji.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.320
You've already formed a heart imprint with Ji Bozai.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.750
Now hurry and see him off

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.120
so we can head to his Spirit Well.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.920
What is it?

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.950
You're worried I might covet the netherbeast army?

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.160
If you are, come with me.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.080
Of course not.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.470
I believe you are just like me.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.030
You won't be tempted by this dangerous power.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.470
It will be cold tonight,

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.880
and your journey will be perilous.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.080
Please take care of yourself.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.470
Would you let him go alone in search of the netherbeasts too?

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:55.750
I mean,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.950
the power of a netherbeast army

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.920
is tempting to everyone, isn't it?

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.270
Right now, aside from myself,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.670
the only person I trust is you, Immortal Ji.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.080
Though he's gone, there's still someone watching me.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.750
Granny Xun,

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.400
did Lord Ji tell you to keep an eye on me?

00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.880
Here, have some Blessing Cakes.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:00.920
I'll just

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.160
sit right here.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.120
I'm not going anywhere.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:03.880
Watch me all you want.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.360
Go on. Try one.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.470
I'm not eating those.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.120
What exactly is your relationship with Ming Xian?

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.470
Since His Lordship spared you,

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.030
you probably aren't a real threat.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.640
But I still have to ask...

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.880
I was engaged to Ming Xian.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.080
Engaged?

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.160
To Ming Xian?

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.030
So you're a spy from Yaoguang Mountain.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:32.920
No, that can't be,

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.360
or Lord Ji would never have spared you.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.190
Since he kept you around,

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.400
you must mean him no harm.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:38.080
But how did you end up in Jixing Abyss,

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.030
in Moonlit Blossoms?

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.230
- I... - Was that Ming Xian

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.610
as shameless as my old man who beat me

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:44.360
every day?

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.600
Did he send you to Moonlit Blossoms to make ends meet?

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.510
In a way, yes.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.190
To think that a Warrior God

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.510
could stoop that low!

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.750
Listen,

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.320
His Lordship won't really hold that against you.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880
He once helped me,

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.990
and I'm sure he's willing to help you too.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:10.560
But you really shouldn't have kept secrets from him.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.400
You really went too far.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.160
Let me tell you...

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.710
Granny Xun?

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:34.800
Granny Xun?

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.400
Ming Yi!

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.030
I've read about the Sunken Abyss.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.270
It looks exactly like this.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.120
Ji Bozai's Spirit Well resembles

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.640
the Sunken Abyss so much.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.840
He's no longer a prisoner,

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.160
yet he's still trapped here.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.080
The Golden Millet Dream is here.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.270
The Golden Millet Dream?

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.400
A blood seal.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.270
Ji Bozai formed a heart imprint with me,

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.360
so he added this seal

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.270
to keep me from taking it.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.950
Let us go, please!

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.750
Please spare us!

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.710
Have mercy on us!

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.400
Let us go, please!

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.770
Please spare us!

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.390
- These... - Please let us go!

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.190
are the spirits of the Sunken Abyss prisoners!

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.750
Please spare us, sir!

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.230
Please let us go!

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:16.560
Weren't those innocents

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:18.190
already released?

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.030
I don't want to die yet.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.190
They didn't get out of the Sunken Abyss safely.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.230
Sir, spare us. Please, I'm begging you!

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.270
Mu Qibai had them captured again.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.360
- Please let us go! - Have mercy on us!

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.750
Please let me go.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.080
Now,

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:42.840
their primordial spirits have been stripped away.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.360
They died here,

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.190
never to be reborn.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.640
We're all innocent.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.870
I really am innocent.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.160
I did nothing wrong!

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.670
Please let me go!

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:56.510
Afraid of you?

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.230
I even recovered from my Withered-Branch Disease.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.880
I'll live on

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:03.920
and grow

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.950
into a towering tree.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:10.270
Sir, my child is still young.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.880
Please, spare us.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.360
Impossible.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.190
Why is Fairy Ruo Shui here?

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.750
Didn't we already...?

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:47.200
Enjoy your meal.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.510
Originally, you only needed to do hard labor in the Sunken Abyss.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.680
It was Ji Bozai who exposed everything.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:57.150
Now, the Sunken Abyss has been sealed,

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.880
and the Judgment Hall has released you.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.950
Even if you know little,

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.680
you might

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.630
accidentally reveal a secret.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:04.920
So we have no choice

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.880
but to turn you into feed.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:13.950
Lord Hanfeng.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.510
Don't blame me.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.990
If you want to blame someone, blame Ji Bozai.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.840
So weak.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.760
Pathetically weak.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:51.720
One twist and you'd snap.

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.510
How will you

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:56.800
survive like this?

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.240
I'm not weak.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:04.720
I... I even recovered from my Withered-Branch Disease.

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.630
I'm tougher than I look.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:10.990
I'll live

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:19.630
and grow into a towering tree.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:22.280
So

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:26.070
you want to be strong too.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.470
I... I was finally saved

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.030
after so much suffering.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.470
I can't let Mother down.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:42.630
I can't waste the effort of those who saved me.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.800
I must live on.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.110
Sure.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.200
Let me help you.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.150
Someone as weak as you

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.110
can never become strong on your own.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.150
Better to take another path:

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.030
become part of someone stronger.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.070
Perhaps

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.590
that's a blessing in disguise.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:22.920
What are you doing?

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.400
I took the Moonshade Grass.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.510
It cured my Withered-Branch Disease.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.280
So

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.400
I want to give this to you as a gift,

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.360
Immortal Ji.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:43.920
My mother gave me this life.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.720
I must live it well.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.200
Thank you, Immortal Ji.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:56.240
