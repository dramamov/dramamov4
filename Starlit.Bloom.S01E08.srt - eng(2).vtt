Gu Liusu!

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:13.000
Gu Liusu.

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.079
The biggest diamond supplier, Mr. Jing,

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.280
is now on Horse Island.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.680
Since when did you become paparazzi?

00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:25.430
Didn't you tell me to be responsible?

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.640
Let's go.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:32.519
Let's go.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.000
Take this.

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:47.879
Look at them.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.200
Lu Xingchen, you're my secretary.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.400
Do you think it's proper

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.480
to have me take the wheel?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.360
I'll drive after this.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:11.639
Let's go.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.560
Alright,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.039
let's go!

00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.800
Are you sure this is the place?

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.800
Of course.

00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:29.590
According to...

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.400
Stand properly.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.439
According to a reliable insider,

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.719
Mr. Jing will be here today
discussing a cultural collaboration.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.879
But I've never seen him before.

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.080
I did.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.439
Come, I'll take you to him.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.479
He's that man in black.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:49.680
Mr. Jing.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.199
Aren't you Mr. Xingchen

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:55.479
from Xinghan?

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:56.960
You know me?

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.360
Then I need not introduce myself.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.800
I'm now the secretary to GL's CEO.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.159
This is my boss.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.319
Hello, pardon me for coming uninvited.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.240
I'm Gu Liusu.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.639
Hello, Ms. Gu.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.400
This way, please.

00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:13.000
Mr. Jing...

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.111
Ms. Gu, this way, please.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.080
I'll park the car.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.280
Mr. Jing.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.919
I actually came
to negotiate a deal with you.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.199
I heard you took over
your father's mines,

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.080
and you're without regular partners.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.759
I wonder if GL might have the honor

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.479
of becoming your long-term partner.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.000
Ms. Gu.

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.680
I admire your sincerity.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.360
I'm very straightforward as well.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.000
Today, apart from work,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.280
I'd like to talk about something else.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.000
We've met before.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.879
Do you still remember?

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.000
Since our last meeting,

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.560
you've left a deep impression on me.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.360
I wonder if our relationship

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.000
could go beyond this.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.039
I have always kept work
and personal life separate.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.719
Feelings and profit
are two different things.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.360
If you have faith in GL's strength,

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.400
I'll give you a good answer.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.120
However,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.480
if you don't believe in us,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.920
we shall consider working with others.

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:29.279
Ms. Gu.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.720
You got this.

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:37.759
Ms. Gu.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.040
Perhaps we could

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.279
spend some time together
as business partners.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.920
Mr. Jing, do you mean...

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.839
I think our cooperation
would be a pleasant one.

By the way,

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:10.360
Xiaolu told me

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.560
that you've put
the Starry Sea project aside.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.279
Why?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.800
Ten years ago, I met a female journalist

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.279
during my field trip abroad.

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:23.800
We clicked instantly

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.959
and became good friends.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.560
Later, war broke out in her country.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.800
She went to the front line.

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:30.639
In her,

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.160
I saw how cruel war really was.

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:35.240
So I wove feathers symbolizing peace

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.519
into an olive branch

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.360
and came up with the Starry Sea.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.680
Both of us thought this design

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:42.639
truly expressed our vision.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.079
That sounds meaningful.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.240
Then why did you stop working on it?

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:54.720
Because she died on the front line.

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:02.360
So...

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.519
What you said
during the radio interview

00:08:08.977 --> 00:08:10.830
wasn't just
to appease public opinion.

00:08:11.977 --> 00:08:13.333
You were telling the truth.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.600
Even now, nearly a million people

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.079
still live in such conditions.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.399
And yet every day,
I just think about diamonds and design.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.000
Sometimes I really feel powerless.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.919
On one hand, you have to network
with diamond tycoons.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.639
On the other hand,

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.759
you feel helpless working
in the diamond industry.

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:48.750
I really can't see through you.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.039
Do what you can first.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.840
Then do what you want.

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:57.840
The former makes my livelihood.

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:01.200
The latter keeps me hopeful.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:13.159
Gu Liusu!

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:16.080
Even if I can't enter your utopia,

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:19.360
I can feel you want it to be beautiful!

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.080
What does the Starry Sea
in your heart look like?

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.519
Just pass the beauty in your heart on.

00:09:50.644 --> 00:09:51.955
Shall we go horseback riding?

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:55.630
On Horse Island, it'd be a waste
if we don't go horseback riding.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.639
We're here after all.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.159
Want to ride a bit?

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:00.320
My Shark is right here anyway.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.320
I'm kind of tired,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.688
so I don't really feel like riding.

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:06.399
Gu Liusu.

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:08.320
If you're scared, just say so.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.039
You aim to be competent

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:11.159
in life and at work.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.519
Turning yourself into someone
who's eager to excel

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.440
isn't a cool thing to do at all.

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:17.120
Who says I'm scared?

00:10:17.155 --> 00:10:18.790
I've actually been raising a horse too.

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:21.240
Do you?

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:23.559
It's you, my little pony.

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:29.080
So you do know how to joke, huh?

00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:30.600
Give it a try.

Here's your chance to teach me.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.159
Get on the horse.

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:50.720
