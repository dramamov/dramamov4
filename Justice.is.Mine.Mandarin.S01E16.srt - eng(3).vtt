WEBVTT

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.400
Chief Justice Lu, I'm sorry.

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.800
You had to come out
even though you're busy.

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:06.933
I am really busy.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Councilor Huang.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.433
Keep it short.

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:10.833
Chief Justice Lu.

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.733
I've been hearing
a lot of news lately.

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.733
Public opinion also supports...

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.000
our development
of the Old City District.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.333
So you want to support...

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.366
your friends
who are in real estate, right?

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.133
We just want to promote...

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.600
Hokong's economic development.

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:26.666
With your intelligence,

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.666
don't you think you can come up...

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.966
with a perfect solution?

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.633
I'll have to see if it's necessary.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.333
As Chief Justice,

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.566
many people are watching me.

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:37.800
I have to set an example.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.166
I can't set a bad one, right?

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.066
Judge Lu, have some coffee.

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:44.166
I'm really busy.

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.533
Let's talk next time.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.300
(Justice is Mine)

00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:19.333
(Episode 16)

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.600
The doctor said...

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.866
even after discharge,

00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:26.600
you have to finish
your anti-inflammatory medicine.

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:28.466
Okay.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.433
Does Yi Wei know
I'll be visiting him?

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:33.000
I've already told him.

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:35.433
I'll go and get the car.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.500
Then you don't have to
walk that far.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.500
Okay.

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:38.833
I'll call you
when I get to the entrance.

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:39.833
Okay, thank you.

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.033
Let's talk.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.633
Are you here to rob me again?

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:51.733
If you approve
my dad's medical parole,

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:53.866
then it won't happen again.

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:56.466
You've got some nerve.

00:03:56.933 --> 00:03:58.333
You failed to kill me.

00:03:58.633 --> 00:03:59.766
Now, you want me to work for you.

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:02.733
My dad has a weak heart.

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:06.933
Plus, my elder brother's murder
was a huge blow to him.

00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:08.666
If something happens
to him in prison,

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:10.966
do you think it might
have something to do with you?

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:14.600
I've prepared all the documents.

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:16.766
Sign this.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.933
Han Kui Long's release
on medical parole...

00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:22.066
would require the approval...

00:04:22.266 --> 00:04:23.766
of the Chief Justice, Judge Lu.

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:25.933
Lu Wei De?

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:29.600
What? Haven't you seen the news?

00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:34.833
Let's talk
after you've watched the news.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800
Right.

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:43.033
There's something
I didn't tell you yet.

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:44.566
From now on,

00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:46.533
I'm in charge of the Han family.

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:58.466
Last night, on the curved slope
of Changyun Road...

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.166
in the Western District,
which is an accident blackspot,

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.533
a serious car accident occurred.

00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:03.033
After the driver was extracted
from the car,

00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:04.033
he was pronounced dead.

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:05.033
It has been confirmed...

00:05:05.233 --> 00:05:06.600
that the deceased...

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.066
is the newly appointed
Chief Justice, Lu Wei De.

00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:09.966
The police's initial speculation...

00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:12.233
is that the accident was caused
by human error.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.866
For more information,

00:05:13.866 --> 00:05:15.566
please tune in to the midday news.

00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:17.766
We'll go to a commercial break now.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.800
Judge Qin.

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:23.266
Excuse me, I'm rushing to a meeting.

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:25.533
What happened to Chief Justice Lu
is truly a shame.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800
Indeed.

00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:31.266
Chief Justice Lu
was a very cautious man.

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:33.666
This car accident
happening to him...

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:35.566
is truly quite unexpected.

00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:37.833
Being cautious is good,

00:05:38.133 --> 00:05:39.133
but being too cautious...

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:40.633
can make you
lose judgment in a crisis.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.466
I'm really busy.

00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:43.966
Let's talk next time.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.200
Councilor Huang.

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:50.466
It's all right.

00:05:50.966 --> 00:05:52.033
If he doesn't want this coffee,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.833
I'll let someone else have it.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400
By the way, Judge Qin,

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:03.733
have you heard...

00:06:03.733 --> 00:06:05.200
about the Old City District
land deed case...

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.266
that Chief Justice Lu was handling?

00:06:09.066 --> 00:06:10.166
Given my rank,

00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:12.433
I don't have access to cases
handled by the Chief Justice.

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:14.333
Given your qualifications,

00:06:14.566 --> 00:06:16.600
you're very likely to take over
his position.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.833
My abilities are limited.

00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:19.966
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have lost to Judge Lu.

00:06:20.566 --> 00:06:21.733
As for the land deed case,

00:06:21.733 --> 00:06:23.200
it's not my area of expertise.

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:24.933
It'll be hard for me
to make a decision...

00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:25.966
that satisfies all parties.

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:27.266
That's not true.

00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:28.833
You handled Shi Zhi Yang's case...

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:30.200
very well.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.333
I think you'll be able
to handle cases...

00:06:32.633 --> 00:06:34.233
that have a social impact.

00:06:34.566 --> 00:06:35.566
The appointment of Chief Justice...

00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:37.233
requires promulgation
from the administrative body.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Judge Qin.

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:42.233
I think you are definitely
the most desirable candidate.

00:06:42.566 --> 00:06:43.600
All you have to do...

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.266
is take over
the Chief Justice position.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.666
Just like the development
of the Old City District,

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:48.666
it's inevitable.

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:49.933
That's where the wind is blowing.

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:53.400
Councilor Huang, excuse me.

00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:55.166
Judge Qin, everyone's here.
It's time for the meeting.

00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:56.933
I'll leave you to it, Judge Qin.

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:58.533
I hope to hear good news...

00:06:58.533 --> 00:07:00.200
about your promotion soon.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.733
In order not to affect the trial,

00:07:06.533 --> 00:07:07.933
Chief Justice Lu's cases...

00:07:08.466 --> 00:07:09.933
will be taken over
by you, Judge Qin.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.033
As for the Chief Justice's
certificate of appointment,

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.066
it will be announced soon.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:16.133
I'm sorry.
I want to think about it first.

00:07:16.233 --> 00:07:17.533
There's no need to think about it.

00:07:17.766 --> 00:07:19.666
If you hadn't withdrawn
so early last time,

00:07:19.933 --> 00:07:22.066
the Chief Justice position
would've been yours.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.666
I think you truly deserve it.

00:07:24.866 --> 00:07:26.066
I still want to think about it.

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:02.266
An inmate riot broke out
at midnight at the Hokong Prison.

00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:03.466
The situation is extremely chaotic.

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:05.366
Armed police have been dispatched...

00:08:05.366 --> 00:08:06.733
to deal with the situation.

00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:17.066
This is an emergency.

00:08:17.066 --> 00:08:18.233
No one can go in.

00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:19.600
No, my son is in there.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.600
I'm sorry, Judge Qin.

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:21.633
We have orders from up top.

00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:22.633
No one can go in.

00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:23.866
Judge Qin.

00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:25.166
The Riot Squad has gone in.

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:26.366
The riot has been quelled.

00:08:26.866 --> 00:08:27.966
Some inmates were injured.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.266
We don't know how your son is yet.

00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:31.366
I want to see my son.

00:08:31.933 --> 00:08:33.400
I'll go in and talk to the warden.

00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:34.433
Don't worry.

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:36.433
I take your matters seriously.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.066
Mr. Feng, wait to hear from me.

00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:40.166
Councilor Huang.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.200
I want to see the warden.

00:08:42.466 --> 00:08:44.233
Councilor Huang is
on the Supervision Committee...

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.866
of the Correctional Services
Department.

00:08:45.866 --> 00:08:47.033
You have no right to stop him.

00:08:47.033 --> 00:08:48.033
Hurry up!

00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:51.133
Please come with me.

00:08:57.933 --> 00:09:00.066
Councilor Huang, you came
all this way so late.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.100
This is a serious matter.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.266
Of course, I had to come right away.

00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:04.866
I'm on the Supervision Committee.

00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:06.633
Supervision is my responsibility.

00:09:07.466 --> 00:09:09.466
It's those gangsters
who were causing trouble.

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:10.866
I took care of it.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.833
I'll keep a closer eye
on them in the future.

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:14.433
I have faith in you.

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:16.566
But the Chief Justice...

00:09:16.566 --> 00:09:17.733
is not too pleased.

00:09:18.466 --> 00:09:19.766
Why is he not pleased?

00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:21.400
I can explain it to him.

00:09:22.433 --> 00:09:23.966
Explain it to him?

00:09:24.266 --> 00:09:25.400
It's better to let him see
with his own eyes...

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.433
that his son is fine.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.800
It's more convincing that way.

00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:29.866
His son?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Qin Yi Wei.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.766
Isn't his dad a judge?

00:09:34.033 --> 00:09:35.033
He's a judge.

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:36.533
But very soon,

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:38.833
he'll be the new Chief Justice.

00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:49.166
- Dad.
- Yi Wei.

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:50.333
Are you okay?

00:09:50.566 --> 00:09:51.566
You're hurt.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800
You're bleeding so much.

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:54.166
It's not my blood.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600
I'm fine.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.800
Hey.

00:10:06.866 --> 00:10:07.866
Are you okay?

00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:10.433
Can you hang in there?

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.600
Is this how you ensure
the safety of the prisoners?

00:10:17.966 --> 00:10:19.533
I promise to tighten security
from now on.

00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:22.166
Sir.

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:23.166
I have a suggestion,

00:10:23.166 --> 00:10:24.166
but I'm not sure
if it's appropriate.

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:25.933
Take Qin Yi Wei, for example.

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:27.733
He's a young man who's willing
to turn over a new leaf.

00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:29.733
He shouldn't be locked up
with the general population.

00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:31.833
There are too many bad people
among the inmates.

00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:33.133
He could easily go astray.

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.200
Is there any chance of him
transferring to a four-person cell?

00:10:36.533 --> 00:10:38.166
The disciplinary rules
there are lighter,

00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:39.166
and the inmates
are about the same age.

00:10:39.766 --> 00:10:40.766
Most importantly,

00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:42.400
Judge Qin won't have to worry.

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:45.166
That's a good idea.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.766
Let's go with that.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.266
Everything is finally settled.

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:58.866
That's why I say...

00:10:58.933 --> 00:11:00.633
there's no problem
that can't be solved.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.466
Thank you for your help...

00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:04.033
with Yi Wei this time,
Councilor Huang.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Judge Qin,

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.000
I heard the Chief Justice's
certificate of appointment...

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
is coming soon.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.966
Should I congratulate you
in advance?

00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:13.266
Can we talk about it later?

00:11:13.733 --> 00:11:14.866
I just got out of the hospital,

00:11:15.366 --> 00:11:16.733
and I'm not feeling well.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.833
Well, Judge Qin, you must take care.

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:21.566
Most importantly, stay healthy.

00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:23.266
You still have to take care
of your son.

00:11:26.566 --> 00:11:27.566
Okay.

00:11:55.033 --> 00:11:56.033
What's wrong?

00:11:58.233 --> 00:11:59.766
It's fine. He's our new friend.

00:11:59.766 --> 00:12:00.766
We'll take good care of him.

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:15.833
You sleep on this bed.

00:12:16.666 --> 00:12:17.733
There's a lot of sunlight,

00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:18.866
and the air is fresh.

00:12:21.766 --> 00:12:22.766
Come.

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:24.666
Come here.

00:12:25.066 --> 00:12:26.066
Sit down.

00:12:27.666 --> 00:12:28.800
Do I have to invite you to sit?

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:31.033
Sit down.

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:36.666
Mr. Lie told us...

00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:38.400
to take good care of you.

00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:41.966
Don't make your dad worry.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.466
He's still new here.

00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:53.766
Go easy on him.

00:12:54.166 --> 00:12:55.866
- Right?
- You're dead if anything happens.

00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:14.266
Congratulations, Chief Justice Qin.

00:13:15.633 --> 00:13:16.633
Is it worth it?

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:19.666
The first day you put on
this judicial robe,

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.433
you set a goal for yourself.

00:13:24.666 --> 00:13:25.733
Do I deserve it?

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.766
You hoped to use the power...

00:13:32.766 --> 00:13:34.000
granted to you as Chief Justice...

00:13:34.366 --> 00:13:36.400
to uphold the rule of law
and justice.

00:13:40.566 --> 00:13:41.800
You're a good father.

00:13:42.566 --> 00:13:43.566
I believe...

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.666
you can still stay true
to your original intention.

00:13:46.866 --> 00:13:47.933
Can I really?

00:13:49.866 --> 00:13:51.800
Chief Justice, it's time for court.

00:13:57.233 --> 00:13:59.066
- What?
- We need to get ready for court.

00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:02.366
Okay.

00:14:04.933 --> 00:14:05.933
Your Honor.

00:14:06.133 --> 00:14:07.966
According to the prosecution,
this land deed...

00:14:07.966 --> 00:14:09.966
was issued by the interim government
100 years ago.

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:11.866
It is permanently valid.

00:14:13.866 --> 00:14:14.866
Your Honor.

00:14:15.266 --> 00:14:17.033
First, that is a fact.

00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:18.133
Second,

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:19.233
the deed stipulates...

00:14:19.366 --> 00:14:21.466
that all land resolutions
in the Old City District...

00:14:21.466 --> 00:14:22.466
must be approved...

00:14:22.666 --> 00:14:24.233
by all residents.

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:25.800
More than half of the residents
must support the resolution...

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800
before it can be implemented.

00:14:29.666 --> 00:14:30.666
My great-grandfather...

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.000
also had an appointment letter
given by the government,

00:14:33.266 --> 00:14:34.466
stating that the men
of our family...

00:14:34.466 --> 00:14:35.533
could inherit the position...

00:14:35.533 --> 00:14:37.166
of Minister of Justice
for generations.

00:14:38.033 --> 00:14:39.033
But then,

00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:40.233
to this day,

00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:42.266
what can a tattered piece
of paper...

00:14:42.666 --> 00:14:44.066
really represent?

00:14:44.966 --> 00:14:46.800
The defense counsel clearly
does not respect...

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.400
the historical credentials
of the indigenous people.

00:14:49.166 --> 00:14:51.066
According to Article 145,
Chapter 2 of the Constitution,

00:14:51.066 --> 00:14:52.133
it is stipulated that...

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:54.933
any archives, documents, or deeds...

00:14:54.933 --> 00:14:56.833
obtained under the original law,

00:14:56.833 --> 00:14:59.466
and the rights
and obligations they contain...

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:01.566
shall remain valid,

00:15:01.566 --> 00:15:02.566
provided they do not
contradict the current law.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.766
They are recognized and protected
by the current government.

00:15:06.733 --> 00:15:08.033
I'm not questioning
the Constitution.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.666
But someone is exploiting
the legitimacy of this land deed.

00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:11.866
Everyone knows...

00:15:11.866 --> 00:15:13.433
that the Old City District
has a high crime rate.

00:15:13.433 --> 00:15:14.566
It's overrun by gangs.

00:15:14.866 --> 00:15:16.766
Can the residents
really vote fairly?

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:18.266
Or are they...

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.933
controlled by a bunch of people...

00:15:19.933 --> 00:15:20.933
with criminal records?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.433
- What did you say?
- What are you saying?

00:15:22.433 --> 00:15:23.533
I dare you to say it again.

00:15:23.866 --> 00:15:25.200
I'll give you a chance
to say it again.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.400
What criminal records?

00:15:29.066 --> 00:15:30.066
You.

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:32.466
Don't insult our Old City District.

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:35.266
Karma will come for you!

00:15:36.066 --> 00:15:37.766
This is a personal attack.

00:15:37.766 --> 00:15:39.366
As the chairman
of the District Committee,

00:15:39.366 --> 00:15:40.400
I'll sue you for defamation.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.833
- We'll sue you for defamation!
- Yes, defamation!

00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:42.966
Do you even know the law?

00:15:43.433 --> 00:15:44.433
- All of us are here!
- That's defamation!

00:15:44.433 --> 00:15:45.433
- Die!
- We'll sue you!

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:48.666
Silence!

00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:50.200
Follow court discipline!

00:15:51.466 --> 00:15:52.466
Defense Counsel.

00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:53.800
Watch your language.

00:15:54.266 --> 00:15:55.266
Yes, Your Honor.

00:15:55.866 --> 00:15:56.866
Prosecution Counsel.

00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:58.600
Do you still insist...

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.800
on your previous claim?

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.800
Your Honor.

00:16:00.833 --> 00:16:01.866
Let me reiterate.

00:16:02.266 --> 00:16:03.666
On behalf of my client,

00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:05.066
I reject all alternatives.

00:16:05.266 --> 00:16:06.533
We refuse to sell the land.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:07.966
We won't sell!

00:16:08.466 --> 00:16:09.800
We won't sell it
for any amount of money.

00:16:10.266 --> 00:16:11.433
- That's right!
- We won't sell it for any amount!

00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:12.666
We won't sell it, I'm telling you!

00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:13.800
Stop dreaming!

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.933
- So what if you're rich?
- That's right!

00:16:16.733 --> 00:16:17.933
I suggest we take
a recess for today.

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:18.933
- No problem.
- Let me tell you!

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.400
What's your opinion?

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.400
- Let's take a recess.
- We won't sell!

00:16:21.433 --> 00:16:22.466
We're not selling it to you!

00:16:25.966 --> 00:16:27.800
The court is calling for a recess.

00:16:28.266 --> 00:16:29.333
When the trial resumes,

00:16:29.733 --> 00:16:31.633
I will make a ruling...

00:16:31.633 --> 00:16:32.633
based on the existing evidence.

00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:33.933
Court is adjourned.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.400
I'm a judge,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600
not a miracle worker.

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:40.933
The deed to the Old City District...

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.333
is legally binding.

00:16:42.666 --> 00:16:44.033
I make my verdicts
based on evidence.

00:16:44.966 --> 00:16:46.433
I don't see any way...

00:16:46.666 --> 00:16:47.833
to change this verdict.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.400
Judge Qin.

00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:51.166
Don't play these games with me.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.866
You know your worth.

00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:57.566
The Old City District land...

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.800
must be mine.

00:16:59.866 --> 00:17:01.666
Even if you can't rule in my favor,
you must do it.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.266
It's the only way to save your son.

00:17:42.633 --> 00:17:43.733
Let's see...

00:17:43.733 --> 00:17:45.400
if the sacrificial lamb...

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400
will end up being me...

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.200
or you guys?

00:18:16.566 --> 00:18:17.566
Congratulations.

00:18:18.366 --> 00:18:20.333
You're the newly appointed
Chief Justice.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.066
I suggest you ask your lawyer...

00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:24.933
to submit your application
through proper channels.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.800
Stop harassing me.

00:18:28.266 --> 00:18:29.666
The document I gave you last time...

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.966
has been reviewed by many lawyers.

00:18:32.466 --> 00:18:34.066
Plus, there's a doctor's diagnosis.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.666
All procedures I've taken
are legal and proper.

00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:38.066
Medical parole...

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.433
doesn't mean release from prison.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.066
If he causes trouble again,

00:18:42.066 --> 00:18:44.333
he can be arrested
and sent back again.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.300
That's right.

00:18:46.533 --> 00:18:47.733
You have the right to apply,

00:18:48.066 --> 00:18:49.433
but the court must follow
the proper procedures...

00:18:50.266 --> 00:18:51.366
to determine whether
approval will be granted.

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:55.166
No problem.

00:18:55.566 --> 00:18:56.633
My dad has been transferred...

00:18:56.633 --> 00:18:57.833
to solitary confinement anyway.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.266
I can wait a few days.

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:02.666
Congratulations to your son too.

00:19:03.233 --> 00:19:04.433
He has been transferred
to a four-person cell.

00:19:05.066 --> 00:19:06.066
Don't worry.

00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:07.200
Someone there...

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.033
will take good care of him.

00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:13.333
Thank you.

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.233
Ms. Lin,

00:19:29.033 --> 00:19:30.433
please pack up my dad's things.

00:19:30.766 --> 00:19:31.766
Then, contact the doctor.

00:19:32.266 --> 00:19:33.366
We'll move him to another hospital.

00:19:33.566 --> 00:19:34.733
Has his medical parole
been approved?

00:19:35.833 --> 00:19:36.833
It's just a matter of time.

00:19:37.266 --> 00:19:38.833
Okay, I'll get ready.

00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:43.233
Young Master Lie.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.400
Say what you want to say.

00:19:48.066 --> 00:19:50.466
If Mr. Long finds out
that his medical parole...

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.300
was a deal...

00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:53.633
made with the killer
of Young Master Gang,

00:19:54.033 --> 00:19:55.033
what will he think?

00:19:58.133 --> 00:20:00.233
We'll worry about that later.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.000
The most important thing is...

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.633
that he'll be released safely.

00:20:07.266 --> 00:20:08.333
Don't worry.

00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:10.533
I just promised
that the judge's son...

00:20:10.533 --> 00:20:11.566
will be unharmed.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.800
As for the rest,

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:15.200
it's out of my control.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.366
Han Kui Long applied
for release on medical parole.

00:20:26.366 --> 00:20:27.633
The court actually approved it.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.400
Qin Yu was the case's
trial court judge.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.400
Didn't he object?

00:20:30.466 --> 00:20:32.466
Qin Yu approved it himself.

00:20:32.466 --> 00:20:33.800
He's the Chief Justice.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.866
Of course, he has that right.

00:20:36.733 --> 00:20:38.366
He's surrendering
to the dark forces.

00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:40.166
What exactly happened?

00:20:40.766 --> 00:20:42.166
Besides being a judge,

00:20:42.166 --> 00:20:43.366
he's also a father.

00:20:43.966 --> 00:20:45.766
He became like this...

00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:47.433
when his son...

00:20:47.433 --> 00:20:49.400
hit Han Gang with his car.

00:20:50.366 --> 00:20:51.833
That doesn't give him the right
to knowingly break the law.

00:20:52.233 --> 00:20:53.233
Do you have proof?

00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:55.266
I will find proof.

00:20:55.966 --> 00:20:56.966
Officer Hu.

00:20:57.266 --> 00:20:58.266
I want to be reinstated.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200
Inspector Tang.

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.333
Are you looking for me?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.766
Judge Qin, you've presided
over cases for so many years.

00:21:12.266 --> 00:21:13.266
You should know...

00:21:13.266 --> 00:21:14.633
what Locard's principle is.

00:21:15.866 --> 00:21:17.433
Criminal psychologists believe...

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.866
that at a crime scene,

00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:21.666
the criminal
might take something away.

00:21:21.933 --> 00:21:23.666
For example, a human life.

00:21:24.733 --> 00:21:25.733
But at the same time,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.533
he'll leave something behind.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.833
That is...

00:21:29.033 --> 00:21:30.466
the evidence of his crime.

00:21:31.533 --> 00:21:32.533
Just because
we can't find anything now...

00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:34.666
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

00:21:35.866 --> 00:21:37.266
Although I can't find anything yet,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.466
I'll keep looking for it.

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:42.166
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry
to go to work.

00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:44.766
Right.

00:21:44.866 --> 00:21:46.166
I forgot to congratulate you.

00:21:46.966 --> 00:21:47.966
You're now...

00:21:48.133 --> 00:21:49.266
the Chief Justice.

00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:51.333
However,

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.266
your actions
can't stay hidden forever.

00:21:53.966 --> 00:21:54.966
Judgment...

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.033
is never in our own hands.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.833
(Coffee Alley)

00:22:43.166 --> 00:22:44.166
Mr. Fei.

00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:45.166
Judge Qin.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.300
It has been a while.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.300
Did you go on a trip?

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.033
Do you want your usual?

00:22:49.133 --> 00:22:50.133
I want double today.

00:22:50.266 --> 00:22:51.633
Sure. Hold on.

00:22:51.966 --> 00:22:53.233
Let me take care
of this order first.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.433
I'll make it for you right away.

00:22:57.033 --> 00:22:58.066
Sign here first.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.400
Okay.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.466
Please inform Councilor Huang.

00:23:14.966 --> 00:23:16.066
There's a piece of evidence...

00:23:16.066 --> 00:23:17.066
in the police administration room.

00:23:17.266 --> 00:23:18.800
If you can get it,

00:23:19.266 --> 00:23:20.266
there's a chance for you to win...

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.400
the Land Deed Case.

00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:37.733
Thank you, everyone.

00:23:38.333 --> 00:23:40.466
Thank you all for supporting me.

00:23:40.666 --> 00:23:43.066
Let me drink a toast
to you all, okay?

00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:44.333
Granduncle.

00:23:44.533 --> 00:23:46.066
Don't force yourself
if you can't drink.

00:23:46.066 --> 00:23:47.066
Let me help you.

00:23:47.166 --> 00:23:48.333
I don't need your help
with this drink.

00:23:49.233 --> 00:23:51.200
Let me add one more thing.

00:23:51.666 --> 00:23:54.566
I'm protecting the rights
of the Old City District.

00:23:54.966 --> 00:23:56.866
I'll drink first to show my respect.

00:23:57.366 --> 00:23:58.666
- Did I say it right?
- Yes.

00:23:58.966 --> 00:23:59.966
Come on.

00:24:06.666 --> 00:24:07.666
Granduncle.

00:24:07.966 --> 00:24:09.266
I'll just drink a little.

00:24:10.133 --> 00:24:11.133
It's fine.

00:24:11.933 --> 00:24:13.600
I'll take him home if he gets drunk.

00:24:14.566 --> 00:24:15.666
You're as clever as always.

00:24:16.366 --> 00:24:18.033
Here's to our swift victory.

00:24:18.266 --> 00:24:19.400
This is my toast...

00:24:19.433 --> 00:24:20.433
to all of you.

00:24:20.466 --> 00:24:22.000
- Here. Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.866
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:30.833
- Granduncle, here's to you.
- Eat up, everyone.

00:24:31.133 --> 00:24:32.166
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:24:32.166 --> 00:24:33.566
He's such a sensible kid.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.633
- Of course. Come on, cheers.
- Cheers.

00:24:36.066 --> 00:24:37.266
Everyone, drink up.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.700
That's right.

00:24:39.266 --> 00:24:41.000
Come on, let's drink too.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.200
Here, Granduncle.

00:24:55.633 --> 00:24:57.033
- Did you find it?
- No.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.400
Check over there.

00:25:06.766 --> 00:25:07.766
Professor Ling.

00:25:08.266 --> 00:25:10.166
You are the court-appointed
appraisal expert.

00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:11.466
Today, you've been summoned...

00:25:11.666 --> 00:25:13.833
to make a professional judgment...

00:25:13.833 --> 00:25:15.033
on this presented old deed.

00:25:15.833 --> 00:25:17.366
The appraisal agency I work for...

00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:19.000
previously conducted...

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.366
a professional assessment
of this deed.

00:25:20.833 --> 00:25:22.733
From the craftsmanship
and materials,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.633
combined with historical documents,

00:25:24.966 --> 00:25:26.433
no anomalies were found.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.800
However, recently,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.933
we handled a forgery case.

00:25:31.266 --> 00:25:32.266
We discovered that...

00:25:32.433 --> 00:25:34.566
the level of forgery by criminals...

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:35.866
is constantly improving.

00:25:35.966 --> 00:25:36.966
Therefore, this time,

00:25:36.966 --> 00:25:38.866
we used an isotope detector...

00:25:39.133 --> 00:25:41.800
to conduct a re-examination
and analysis of this deed.

00:25:42.433 --> 00:25:43.433
So, what is your conclusion?

00:25:45.433 --> 00:25:46.766
This old deed...

00:25:46.766 --> 00:25:48.966
is a highly realistic forgery.

00:25:53.733 --> 00:25:55.033
How is that possible?

00:25:55.633 --> 00:25:56.933
- What the heck?
- Are you really an expert?

00:25:57.666 --> 00:25:58.666
What nonsense are you saying?

00:25:58.933 --> 00:25:59.933
That's outrageous.

00:26:00.066 --> 00:26:01.066
Silence!

00:26:05.466 --> 00:26:06.733
This deed...

00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:09.600
has been kept for over 100 years.

00:26:10.233 --> 00:26:11.566
It can't be fake!

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.200
Your Honor.

00:26:13.566 --> 00:26:15.600
My conclusion is in the report.

00:26:15.833 --> 00:26:16.833
Your Honor.

00:26:17.266 --> 00:26:18.366
This forensic report...

00:26:18.366 --> 00:26:20.333
was submitted as Exhibit 08.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.733
Let me see. It can't be fake!

00:26:28.366 --> 00:26:29.366
Your Honor.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.600
On behalf of my client,

00:26:30.866 --> 00:26:31.866
I request...

00:26:31.933 --> 00:26:33.033
a re-appraisal of this deed.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.533
This is a court-approved...

00:26:36.533 --> 00:26:37.666
professional appraisal agency.

00:26:38.066 --> 00:26:39.333
I do not believe...

00:26:39.333 --> 00:26:40.333
that going to another institute...

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:42.033
will yield a different outcome.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.366
Court-approved?

00:26:45.466 --> 00:26:46.800
You're clearly in cahoots!

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.266
You conspired
to make us lose, right?

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.833
Maintain court discipline.

00:26:52.266 --> 00:26:53.733
The court has not ruled yet.

00:26:56.333 --> 00:26:58.033
I swear on my life...

00:26:58.866 --> 00:27:00.033
that this deed...

00:27:00.433 --> 00:27:02.233
is 100 percent real!

00:27:02.666 --> 00:27:04.300
I can understand...

00:27:04.733 --> 00:27:06.233
the prosecution's
subjective emotions.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800
But in court,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.233
both the prosecution and defense...

00:27:10.466 --> 00:27:11.633
must only present...

00:27:11.866 --> 00:27:13.766
objective evidence.

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:15.800
You're all corrupt officials!

00:27:15.933 --> 00:27:16.933
You're in cahoots!

00:27:16.933 --> 00:27:18.266

- Hey, call an ambulance!
- Ambulance!

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.933
- Call an ambulance now!
- Granduncle.

00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:33.366
Granduncle, are you okay?

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.400
- Granduncle!
- Granduncle!

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.733
- Granduncle!
- Granduncle!

Congratulations.

to your generosity...

00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:19.633
are the rising stars of Hokong,

00:28:20.233 --> 00:28:22.133
- Qi Chang Rong, Mr. Qi.
- Mr. Zhong.

00:28:22.566 --> 00:28:23.600
- Nice to meet you.
- This is...

00:28:23.733 --> 00:28:25.033
Han Lie, Second Master Han.

00:28:25.033 --> 00:28:26.033
Second Master Han.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.200
Please, have a seat.

00:28:27.466 --> 00:28:28.466
- Have a seat.
- Have a seat.

00:28:32.066 --> 00:28:33.600
The Han family and the Qi family...

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.866
are now able
to sit at the same table,

00:28:35.066 --> 00:28:36.566
talking and drinking together.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.200
Councilor Huang,

00:28:38.233 --> 00:28:39.933
you've truly made
a great contribution...

00:28:40.266 --> 00:28:42.166
to the unity of Hokong.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.400
Hello, Dad.

00:28:45.166 --> 00:28:46.800
How are you? Are you okay?

00:28:51.566 --> 00:28:52.566
Hello?

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800
Hello?

00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:00.133
Don't worry. Carry on.

00:29:02.466 --> 00:29:04.066
Hello, Dad.
What did you say just now?

00:29:04.066 --> 00:29:05.200
I couldn't quite hear you.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.533
After moving to a four-person cell,

00:29:06.533 --> 00:29:07.566
are things any better?

00:29:11.266 --> 00:29:12.266
Yes.

00:29:12.666 --> 00:29:13.666
It's a little better.

00:29:14.966 --> 00:29:15.966
That's good.

00:29:18.266 --> 00:29:19.866
It's been getting cold lately.

00:29:19.866 --> 00:29:20.933
Do you have enough clothes?

00:29:23.666 --> 00:29:25.600
I heard that Judge Qin...

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.833
is very stubborn.

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:29.066
How did you take care of him?

00:29:30.966 --> 00:29:31.966
Five words.

00:29:32.766 --> 00:29:34.133
To each their own need.

00:29:34.766 --> 00:29:35.833
There's nothing we can't handle.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.266
What about...

00:29:39.933 --> 00:29:41.033
the deed in court?

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.266
It's also five words.

00:29:43.433 --> 00:29:44.933
Let fate take its course.

00:29:44.933 --> 00:29:46.200
It all worked out naturally.

00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:53.533
No matter how I look at it,

00:29:54.666 --> 00:29:56.066
this deed couldn't possibly be fake.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Impossible.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.200
Granduncle.

00:30:00.633 --> 00:30:01.633
Don't be like this.

00:30:02.033 --> 00:30:03.033
Just...

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.066
put away this deed.

00:30:05.966 --> 00:30:07.866
The judge has already ruled it fake.

00:30:08.033 --> 00:30:09.866
It's as good as scrap paper.

00:30:09.866 --> 00:30:11.333
It doesn't matter
if we keep it or not.

00:30:11.866 --> 00:30:13.166
That's true.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.966
But since you're our chairman,

00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:16.600
we'll have to trouble you
to gather our villagers...

00:30:16.766 --> 00:30:18.566
and try to negotiate
a good price.

00:30:18.566 --> 00:30:20.133
That's all we can do now.

00:30:20.666 --> 00:30:22.633
But I also need
you and Chang Rong...

00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:24.933
to talk to the people
of the Old City District first.

00:30:24.933 --> 00:30:25.933
No problem.

00:30:26.466 --> 00:30:28.766
Our fellow villagers' business
is our business too.

00:30:28.766 --> 00:30:30.833
We will go through fire and water
for them till the very end.

00:30:31.233 --> 00:30:32.233
Thank you.

00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:34.166
Everyone.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.566
The court's decision...

00:30:35.566 --> 00:30:36.600
is in my hands.

00:30:37.066 --> 00:30:39.233
The land acquisition project
can be fully launched.

00:30:39.766 --> 00:30:41.466
I'd like to propose another toast.

00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:42.666
Here's to the success...

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.566
of the Old City District
Development Project.

00:30:46.066 --> 00:30:47.200
Let's work together...

00:30:47.633 --> 00:30:48.633
and share the success.

00:30:49.033 --> 00:30:50.033
Cheers!

00:30:58.033 --> 00:30:59.433
I have two friends who are here.

00:30:59.433 --> 00:31:00.466
I'm going to say hello.

00:31:00.966 --> 00:31:01.966
Enjoy the meal.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.866
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.

00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:13.433
I'm going to the restroom.

00:31:16.333 --> 00:31:18.033
They wouldn't let me leave
until I had two drinks.

00:31:18.033 --> 00:31:19.033
Goodness.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.633
Don't give me that.

00:31:21.633 --> 00:31:22.633
Just drink and eat.

00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:23.766
It's not like I was waiting for you.

00:31:24.333 --> 00:31:25.333
Hey, Officer Da.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.733
I really must toast you.

00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:29.266
If you hadn't swapped the deeds
this time,

00:31:29.466 --> 00:31:30.866
we might not have made it through.

00:31:31.466 --> 00:31:33.000
If Qin Yu hadn't reminded me,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.133
I would've really forgotten.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.800
During the forged documents
case last year,

00:31:37.433 --> 00:31:38.800
a whole set of tools
was confiscated...

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.833
and stored in the evidence room.

00:31:40.566 --> 00:31:41.833
That set of tools is very useful.

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:44.000
No matter
if it's a government document...

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.233
or a medal,

00:31:45.466 --> 00:31:46.866
it can be made to look real.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.733
Even experts
can't tell the difference.

00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:51.666
That case was handled by Judge Qin.

00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:53.000
Of course, he remembers it clearly.

00:31:55.666 --> 00:31:58.566
Smart people are truly quick-witted.

00:31:58.833 --> 00:31:59.833
Then let's raise a glass...

00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:02.000
to our eye for good people.

00:32:02.266 --> 00:32:03.266
Come on.

00:32:03.266 --> 00:32:04.266
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.066
If you can't touch Judge Qin,

00:32:14.233 --> 00:32:15.233
I wonder if you'll suffer
from kidney failure...

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:16.233
from holding it in.

00:32:16.566 --> 00:32:17.566
It's none of your business.

00:32:18.033 --> 00:32:19.066
How is it not my business?

00:32:20.266 --> 00:32:22.366
I still have to return
this bullet to him.

00:32:25.266 --> 00:32:26.433
His life is mine.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.200
I have my own plans...

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.800
for when to make a move on him.

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:33.166
Fine.

00:32:33.366 --> 00:32:34.366
I won't fight with you.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Even if I don't get
to take his life,

00:32:36.433 --> 00:32:37.633
I'll have to collect some interest.

00:32:38.166 --> 00:32:39.166
Do you need help?

00:32:46.233 --> 00:32:47.233
Mr. Huang.

00:32:47.266 --> 00:32:48.566
Qi Chang Rong wants to use...

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:49.833
the public's anger
in the land case...

00:32:49.833 --> 00:32:50.833
against Judge Qin.

00:32:52.266 --> 00:32:53.266
It's okay.

00:32:53.766 --> 00:32:55.233
Making them
look like unruly citizens...

00:32:55.233 --> 00:32:56.366
is good for our land acquisition.

00:32:56.966 --> 00:32:58.000
But don't go too far.

00:32:58.466 --> 00:33:00.166
Qin Yu is still useful to us.

00:33:00.466 --> 00:33:01.800
People never change.

00:33:02.766 --> 00:33:04.066
I don't believe those two...

00:33:04.466 --> 00:33:05.766
can restrain themselves
from causing trouble.

00:33:05.966 --> 00:33:07.333
Triads...

00:33:07.633 --> 00:33:08.633
can only be used as a tool.

00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:09.666
They can't be trusted.

00:33:10.266 --> 00:33:12.066
If we want peace and prosperity,

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.600
we have to rely on you, Officer Da.

00:33:16.233 --> 00:33:17.266
Come on, cheers!

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:22.566
You corrupt official!

00:33:23.766 --> 00:33:24.866
You're colluding with businessmen!

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.400
Come out!

00:33:26.866 --> 00:33:28.633
Come out! Come out!

00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:30.000
You corrupt official! Come out!

00:33:30.233 --> 00:33:31.466
You're colluding with businessmen!

00:33:31.466 --> 00:33:33.166
- Corrupt official!
- Corrupt official!

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.400
Come out!

00:33:41.466 --> 00:33:42.833
- Come out!
- Come out!

00:33:42.833 --> 00:33:43.833
Come out!

00:33:44.833 --> 00:33:45.833
Corrupt official!

00:33:46.233 --> 00:33:47.366
You're colluding with businessmen!

00:33:48.666 --> 00:33:50.633
- Come out!
- What kind of official are you?

00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:51.833
Corrupt official!

00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:53.233
Get out here!

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:56.066
Come out!

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.400
- Come out!
- Come out!

00:34:00.066 --> 00:34:01.066
Let's go.

00:34:21.433 --> 00:34:22.433
Madam.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Where's Judge Qin?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.833
Madam, Judge Qin
is downstairs in the study.

00:34:43.666 --> 00:34:44.766
What a surprise.

00:34:45.466 --> 00:34:47.633
I never expected that you'd be
called a corrupt official one day.

00:34:50.466 --> 00:34:51.466
I didn't deny it.

00:34:53.533 --> 00:34:54.933
I could understand it...

00:34:55.533 --> 00:34:56.733
when you were trying
to protect your son.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.333
But why did you frame Shi Zhi Yang?

00:34:59.666 --> 00:35:00.733
What did you get out of it?

00:35:01.266 --> 00:35:02.466
Did you become the Chief Justice...

00:35:02.966 --> 00:35:04.733
and colluded with Da Gama...

00:35:05.466 --> 00:35:07.066
in exchange for his protection?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
These...

00:35:10.466 --> 00:35:11.800
are just your speculations.

00:35:14.333 --> 00:35:15.533
I trust Shi Zhi Yang.

00:35:16.166 --> 00:35:17.166
So I believe...

00:35:17.933 --> 00:35:19.066
that your ruling on him...

00:35:20.033 --> 00:35:21.033
was wrong.

00:35:23.666 --> 00:35:24.666
Guo Hua.

00:35:24.733 --> 00:35:25.766
Take Judge Qin's statement.

00:35:26.566 --> 00:35:27.566
Inspector Tang.

00:35:30.633 --> 00:35:32.566
Historically, what has it taken...

00:35:32.833 --> 00:35:33.833
to right a wrong?

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.200
Time.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.100
That means...

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.233
what you see now...

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.866
isn't the final result yet.

00:35:52.933 --> 00:35:53.933
When the prosecution...

00:35:53.933 --> 00:35:55.966
handed over the case to the judge,

00:35:55.966 --> 00:35:57.400
there was this list.

00:35:57.833 --> 00:35:59.033
When the arson case back then...

00:35:59.666 --> 00:36:00.966
came into my hands,

00:36:01.133 --> 00:36:02.366
after verification,

00:36:02.766 --> 00:36:04.433
I noticed that
a witness statement,

00:36:04.433 --> 00:36:06.600
labeled A05, was missing.

00:36:07.466 --> 00:36:09.066
So I asked them to resubmit it.

00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:10.466
Later on, this case...

00:36:10.766 --> 00:36:12.600
was handed over
to another prosecutor.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.566
I don't know if the statement...

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.266
was resubmitted or not.

00:36:17.766 --> 00:36:19.033
Didn't you tell Shi Zhi Yang...

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.866
that you didn't remember anything?

00:36:22.233 --> 00:36:23.600
Perhaps it's because I'm old now.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.200
My memory isn't very stable.

00:36:27.066 --> 00:36:28.066
What I want to ask is,

00:36:29.066 --> 00:36:30.800
why are you telling me this now?

00:36:32.466 --> 00:36:33.933
Consider it my way
of repaying you...

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.600
for saving me in the parking lot.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.600
How did it go?

00:36:49.433 --> 00:36:50.433
It was the villagers...

00:36:50.433 --> 00:36:51.633
from the Old City District
who lost the lawsuit.

00:36:52.466 --> 00:36:53.566
We arrested the ringleaders.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
They'll be charged...

00:36:55.166 --> 00:36:56.400
with criminal damage
and attempted assault.

00:36:56.633 --> 00:36:57.733
Is Qin Yu all right?

00:36:58.233 --> 00:36:59.233
Do you know...

00:36:59.266 --> 00:37:01.833
that many eyes are on him now?

00:37:02.466 --> 00:37:03.933
We have to handle this quietly.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Hey.

00:37:07.566 --> 00:37:08.566
Hello?

00:37:09.033 --> 00:37:10.133
I'm talking to you.

00:37:10.133 --> 00:37:11.166
Didn't you hear me?

00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:16.266
Qin Yu told me that...

00:37:16.833 --> 00:37:18.600
on the list of evidence
for the arson case,

00:37:18.933 --> 00:37:20.000
there was originally
a witness statement,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.800
labeled A05.

00:37:22.366 --> 00:37:23.466
But during the trial,

00:37:23.666 --> 00:37:25.333
this statement suddenly disappeared.

00:37:25.866 --> 00:37:27.466
I don't know
if it was an oversight...

00:37:27.833 --> 00:37:29.166
or if someone took it on purpose.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.866
If it was deemed useless...

00:37:31.066 --> 00:37:32.266
or unnecessary,

00:37:32.266 --> 00:37:33.366
they don't have to
submit it to court.

00:37:33.766 --> 00:37:34.766
It's normal.

00:37:35.033 --> 00:37:36.233
I don't know if it's normal or not.

00:37:36.833 --> 00:37:37.833
I just know...

00:37:37.833 --> 00:37:38.833
that at this stage,

00:37:38.833 --> 00:37:40.133
this A05 statement...

00:37:40.366 --> 00:37:41.666
is our only lead.

00:37:41.666 --> 00:37:42.666
Don't do it.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.833
If you open this file,

00:37:45.066 --> 00:37:46.766
Da Gama will surely know.

00:37:47.266 --> 00:37:49.233
Besides, you don't
even have access...

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:50.766
to the headquarters' archives.

00:37:54.466 --> 00:37:56.766
Don't look at me like that.

00:38:02.633 --> 00:38:03.833
I won't help you.

00:38:04.466 --> 00:38:07.200
It might be 1977 or 1978.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.400
How about this?

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.400
Can you show me...

00:38:09.766 --> 00:38:11.033
all the closed arson cases...

00:38:11.033 --> 00:38:12.033
from the past two years?

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.133
I also want those that didn't go
to the initial trial.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.333
That means I want...

00:38:17.466 --> 00:38:19.366
all the most complete
statement records.

00:38:19.666 --> 00:38:21.133
That might be a lot of data.

00:38:21.466 --> 00:38:22.600
Not at all.

00:38:23.233 --> 00:38:25.833
Just find everything on my list.

00:38:25.833 --> 00:38:27.933
I just want to go through
the main points.

00:38:28.633 --> 00:38:30.000
I even brought my colleague...

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.266
to help me out.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.700
I promise...

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.833
I'll let you get off work
at 6pm sharp.

00:38:36.533 --> 00:38:38.000
Okay, Officer Hu,
please give me your permit...

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
for registration.

00:38:39.133 --> 00:38:40.566
- This is the rule.
- Of course.

00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:42.966
Thank you for your help.

00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:46.933
Once I've looked at a file
and confirmed it,

00:38:46.933 --> 00:38:48.666
I'll tell you the file number.

00:38:48.666 --> 00:38:49.666
Okay.

00:39:24.166 --> 00:39:25.166
- Officer Hu.
- Yes.

00:39:25.166 --> 00:39:26.266
Have you figured out
which file you want to see?

00:39:26.833 --> 00:39:28.266
It's this one.

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:29.933
Thank you so much.

00:39:30.033 --> 00:39:31.166
None of these three is it.

00:39:31.266 --> 00:39:32.266
I'll return them to you first.

00:39:32.966 --> 00:39:34.566
Okay. Then I'll register this one.

00:39:34.566 --> 00:39:35.566
Okay.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.866
You two take your time.

00:39:37.866 --> 00:39:39.033
I'll put the others back.

00:39:39.033 --> 00:39:40.033
Thank you, Madam.

00:39:40.533 --> 00:39:41.533
Hey, hurry up and read it!

00:39:41.533 --> 00:39:42.833
Don't keep the officer at work.

00:39:42.833 --> 00:39:43.833
We have to leave at six.

00:39:44.066 --> 00:39:45.066
Here.

00:39:59.066 --> 00:40:00.066
Did you find anything?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
This A05 statement...

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.633
is an eyewitness statement.

00:40:04.266 --> 00:40:05.266
Although it's incomplete,

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.433
but at least
two eyewitnesses claimed...

00:40:07.833 --> 00:40:10.333
that they saw a strange, tall man...

00:40:10.333 --> 00:40:11.833
at the scene.

00:40:12.166 --> 00:40:13.166
One of them also said...

00:40:13.266 --> 00:40:14.966
that the man was wearing a vest.

00:40:15.233 --> 00:40:16.666
He had a scar on his right shoulder,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
shaped like an earthworm.

00:40:18.366 --> 00:40:20.766
This man is the real arsonist?

00:40:22.433 --> 00:40:23.766
Who is this man?

00:40:24.766 --> 00:40:26.600
And who is protecting him?

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.700
Chief Justice Qin.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.766
Someone from the Correctional
Services Department is here.

00:41:09.766 --> 00:41:10.766
They're here to pick up a document.
