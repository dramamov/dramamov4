WEBVTT

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.640
This girl needs help.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.680
We accept this request.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.960
But you live outside.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.640
It's not convenient for us to communicate.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.319
Yeah.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.039
It takes half a day to inform someone.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.880
Is there a hotel nearby?

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.480
What?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.320
Motel?

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.120
No.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.440
Not to mention the hotel,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.560
Not even a bridge.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.760
All right, stop acting.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.080
Come back to live these days.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800
If you have any news, we can communicate at any time.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.920
Letâ€™s perform together.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.200
How is it?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.440
Any progress?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.880
No.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.840
The key point.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.720
I can't touch it now.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.520
Any news from the police?

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.200
I haven't seen Zhou Mu these days.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.080
Qin Shan knows nothing about it.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.200
I think we're in the wrong direction.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.760
Are you

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.560
also looking for the murderer who killed my sister?

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.800
Sit.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.120
What else do you know?

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.600
you can tell us.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.240
I only remember that my sister told me

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.440
she left in a foreign car.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.120
She said it was too late.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.440
and asked me to wait for her at the door.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.280
But I waited for more than two hours.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.120
but I couldn't.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.560
Until the next morning,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.840
I knew something happened to her.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.680
The foreign car was only half an hour away.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.960
What could happen?

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.840
Are you sure she got on a foreign car?

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.440
I saw her in a foreign car.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.360
A foreign car?

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.040
I threw it

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.200
I threw her in front of the school.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.120
Yang asked me the next day.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.079
Why didn't you call me?

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.280
You can't even do that.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.600
But

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.200
the woman was so tender the night before yesterday.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.960
She's so tender that she can squeeze water out.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.600
You're bragging.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.320
Show it to everyone.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.920
Yes.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.880
Really?

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.520
Show me.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.280
I'll blow it.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.880
I'll show you today.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:57.960
Hurry up.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.680
Slow down.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680
Don't break it.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.840
He Wang.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.440
You've ruined such a young lady.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.960
She looks like a student.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.800
Hina!

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.800
You...

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.640
You're so pretty.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.440
You ruined

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.520
is ruined by you.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.160
Get lost!

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.160
I'm lucky in love.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.920
Give it to me.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.360
Wang.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.560
Do you have to

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.920
at night?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.120
Listen, newcomers.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.560
I'm telling you

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.600
Photos are very important.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.440
Why?

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.240
Why

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.760
You know nothing.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.560
We used to do things after we fainted.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.840
We used to threaten people when they woke up.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.600
Right?

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.240
Yes.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.840
The problem is

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.440
if she meets a tough woman one day,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.200
she pretends to agree,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.880
and call the police. What should we do?

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.600
What should we do?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.800
At this time,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.280
this photo

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.240
will be useful.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.080
All women are shameless.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.200
As long as we tell her,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.120
If you call the police, I'll spread the photo.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.520
If I go in,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.960
don't be a human.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.040
Wang.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.480
You're really something.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.080
That's a good move.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.400
Yes.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.480
The key is

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.320
we have the photos.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.440
We can do whatever we want.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.520
Look.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.680
Brother Wang

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.440
is capable.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.800
That's right.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.640
Enough.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.120
Let's call it a day.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.120
I just received a message today.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.240
The higher-ups asked us to be safe.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.040
Cao Cong.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.480
How could you be so careless?

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.600
You all just joined the alliance.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.160
I told you to behave when you just got here.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.400
It's a bit unfair indeed.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.920
But it's a side door.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.600
We have to follow the rules.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.640
First,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.960
you can't do anything on the 15th of every month.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.320
Because these two days is the city's inspection.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.280
and patrol outside.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.640
Second,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.240
One woman can't do twice.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.880
Understand?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.760
Yes.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.680
Third,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.560
You can't touch an official's lady.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.840
and foreigners.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.720
This is the rule of our alliance.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.080
Follow the rules and live happily together.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.600
It's against the rules.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.240
I...

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.520
Got it.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.880
Rules

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.280
Follow the rules.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.360
There's nothing we can do.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.880
We're working for that gentleman.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.680
Why are we still talking about rules?

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.480
He Wang.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.480
Our alliance

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.760
thanks to the gentleman

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.560
to cover up for us.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.920
So just do your job.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.840
Don't break the bottom line.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.760
We don't know who's covering up for.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.960
I'll take someone to sell it in other places.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.640
He Wang.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.720
The lights are off. Keep up.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.240
Three, three, six, three, four.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.760
Girl,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.040
Are you in a movie?

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.039
No.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.280
You look like a star.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.000
You flatter me.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.640
I'm just an ordinary person.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.840
Can you be 18?

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.520
A student?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.240
Are you thirsty?

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880
There's soda in the back seat.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.680
Take it if you're thirsty.
