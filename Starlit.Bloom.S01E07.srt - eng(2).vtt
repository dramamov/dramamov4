00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.060
(22 July, Friday, 8:59 AM)

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.149
Secretary Lu is late.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.511
His pay has been deducted.

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:19.439
Good morning!

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.040
"Good morning"?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.840
Who invented

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.159
"good morning" anyway?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.560
I can't believe you're slacking off.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.879
You almost ran late.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:41.040
You almost got an earful
from Ms. Gu this morning.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:44.159
You have no idea,
when I was riding my motorcycle

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:45.560
this morning,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.079
the wind was blasting my head.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.159
I felt like...

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.000
What's this?

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:50.680
I don't think I've seen this before.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.560
I designed it.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.760
You're in admin
and you know how to design?

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.120
Are you joking?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.560
I won four consecutive...

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.229
Forget it.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.711
I won't bore you with my glory days.
You wouldn't get it anyway.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.400
The focus of my design

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.200
isn't the style.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.560
It's the materials.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.199
Materials?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.080
Recyclable, biodegradable,
and low-carbon production.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.879
All environmentally certified.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.759
Here's a simple example for you.

00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:20.870
Ocean aluminum is made

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.400
by extracting aluminum

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.080
from abandoned fishing boats
and marine debris.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.680
Sea glass is tiny fragments
polished by seawater

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.479
that resemble gems.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.159
Combined,

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.039
that's my

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.759
"Tears of the Deep Sea" design.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.280
I suggest Starry Sea switch

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.960
to eco-friendly materials too.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.800
But eco materials

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.039
don't look as pretty.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.599
Ms. Gu.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.199
GL has always used diamonds.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.840
How basic are you?

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.159
Ms. Gu,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.520
the visual effect

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.680
is essentially the same.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.680
Recycled precious metals

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.520
come from extracting gold and platinum

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.560
from electronic waste

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.360
and old jewelry.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.719
Deep sea coral jewelry

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.879
uses bleached, dead coral skeletons

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.199
turned into ceramics.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.120
Very eco-friendly.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.360
If we

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.439
overharvest these resources,

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.520
they'll run out someday,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.080
right?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.800
Sounds good enough,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.280
but diamonds still feel more luxurious.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.199
But isn't this much more meaningful?

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.360
Xiaolu, come with me.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.759
Research

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:33.080
which eco-friendly materials
on the market are reliable.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.080
Verify their prices and costs.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.520
Got it.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.360
Xuan.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.400
Do some market research

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.560
to see which companies are using
eco-friendly materials for accessories.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.800
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.879
(He knows about eco materials too.)

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.830
(Maybe he's not completely useless,
after all.)

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.800
Get busy.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.680
Market research won't be easy.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.080
These days,
fewer young people are getting married.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.080
Jewelry sales are down.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.039
This year,
the whole industry is down 40%.

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:06.000
Although marriage rates are dropping,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
more women are willing
to spend on themselves now.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.159
We should focus

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.879
on promoting women's empowerment,

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.759
not just love stories.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.759
That's a bit outdated.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.639
True.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.120
But promoting romantic collections
is Liusu's marketing plan.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.319
Wasn't she always
"a woman needs no man" type?

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:29.879
That's the thing. Someone like her

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.079
actually believes in love.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.199
Let's get to work.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.199
- Get to work.
- Let's go.

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.439
Actually, I think the material

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.519
he suggested

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:51.120
might work.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.399
I'll do some research.

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.399
She believes in love.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.279
She believes in love...

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:14.639
(He has a point.)

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.639
(We should create a meaningful product.)

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:22.000
What are you looking at?

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.360
But that's

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.399
a day's worth of work.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.720
You want me to do this

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.560
and that.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600
You're exploiting me...

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.360
Mr. Xingchen.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.600
Do you need a ride?

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.519
Well, Lu

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:59.240
likes to do things on his own.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.120
Right,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.279
Mo Li?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.560
I'm heading off, Ms. Gu.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.879
See you!

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:07.680
Ms. Liusu.

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.199
Mo Li.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.000
Do you have a moment

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.800
to talk?

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:14.800
Of course.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.040
Where are you headed?

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:17.022
I'll give you a lift.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.839
Mo Li.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.040
Xinyi Jewelry opened branches

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.639
in all eight
of Xinghan's shopping malls.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.040
Did you know about this?

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:37.319
Yes.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:39.720
Xinyi is a long-established
jewelry brand.

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:41.360
Now that they're expanding,

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:43.240
Xinghan is happy to welcome them.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.639
But coincidentally,

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.800
all their stores are right next to GL's.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:51.040
Well,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.000
I'm not too sure.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.600
All my store managers are complaining

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.444
that Xinyi is engaging
in cutthroat competition.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.519
I want Xinghan

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.720
to grant GL an exclusive contract.

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:08.120
Ms. Gu,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.199
that probably wouldn't be fair.

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.279
What's unfair about it?

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:14.399
That old guy is clearly
trying to sabotage us.

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.079
I'm going to expose him!

00:07:18.244 --> 00:07:20.040
Is this really the time
for you to butt in?

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.720
I'm just concerned.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.600
Carry on.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:28.560
Don't mind me.

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:34.079
Gold and jewelry prices are fixed.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.439
Isn't it going too far

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.480
that they're starting a price war?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.759
All right, then.

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:41.509
Ms. Gu,

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.000
let me investigate the matter further.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.120
If they have undercut the market price,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.279
Xinghan will step in.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.759
Also, Mo Li,

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:50.240
stop coming to my workplace.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.920
I made a deal with Ms. Gu.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.879
My mission now

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:55.189
is to be an excellent secretary

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.111
and forget
I'm the son of a wealthy family.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:02.959
Ms. Gu,

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.750
please take care of Mr. Xingchen for me.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.279
I won't butt in again.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.080
Ms. Gu,

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:34.879
please be seated.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.279
I'll get you your coffee.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.519
Here's your coffee, Miss.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.799
Do you know why I let you into GL?

00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:00.240
Because you liked my design.

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:10.559
Because Tang Baozhu begged on my behalf.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.120
I heard from Dr. Yu

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.440
that Baozhu took you to see him.

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:21.600
I'm sorry.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.799
It's true I don't remember much
about those childhood days.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.919
It's all right.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.519
Thanks for what you did

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.440
at the meeting

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.519
that day.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.960
I just looked into it a bit.

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:46.799
I don't want to be used.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.159
I owe you

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:55.440
an apology too.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.639
We're all adults here.

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:01.679
I'll be frank.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:04.799
I wasn't keen on having you at GL

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.639
because of what happened that night.

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:09.080
But now I've seen how capable you are.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.000
Lu Xingchen,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.399
welcome officially to GL
as part of the team.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.639
Let's leave

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.679
the past behind.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.440
Maybe we'll even
write a new chapter together.

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:38.440
A new chapter?

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.288
Our relationship
is strictly professional.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.559
Well...

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:44.080
Stop.

00:10:44.866 --> 00:10:46.720
I didn't mean anything else
when I said that.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.879
I just thought

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.759
it'd be better to clear the air

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.360
so that we can work together normally.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.360
Right?

00:10:57.169 --> 00:10:58.720
The truth is,

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:00.799
nothing happened that night.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.039
You were already unconscious
when I got to you.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.519
I checked the security footage

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:09.600
and found out
that someone had drugged you.

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:12.840
But I'm a gentleman.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.177
I didn't lay a finger on you.

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:15.000
But

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.080
I remember

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:19.120
we washed up together...

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.720
You threw up all over the place.
I helped wash your feet.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.000
When I woke up the next day...

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.200
I got someone else
to help take your clothes off.

I just thought your misunderstanding

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:38.269
was kind of funny.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.688
I just wanted to mess with you.

00:11:39.711 --> 00:11:41.870
Besides, you didn't give me
a chance to explain either.

00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:42.960
Lu Xingchen!

It's GL!

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:10.360
You even got the name wrong.

00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:15.360
(I used to believe some people
are just meant)

00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:17.440

like shooting stars.)

brightest spark)
