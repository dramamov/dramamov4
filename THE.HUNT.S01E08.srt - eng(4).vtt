[THE HUNT]

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.440
[Name: Ni Xiangdong]

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.590
[He feels the silence pent up inside him]

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.150
[roaring and screaming, deafeningly loud.]

[Episode 8: Living on Borrowed Time]

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.360
I'll carry it myself.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.470
[Police]

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.870
Here.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.730
What's this?

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.080
I bought it at the town market.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.140
A coconut carving.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.890
Why didn't you give it to me
on the way here?

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.070
I was afraid people would see

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.750
and gossip,

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.290
saying that Weihai Police

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.180
don't do real work

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.360
and use public funds to date.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.720
You're really something.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.050
Dating on public funds?

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.720
Have you no shame?

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.530
I spent money

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.830
on the gift I gave you.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.920
You can't talk to me like that.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.430
What did you give me?

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.040
A turtle?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.520
Implying I work too slow?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.400
I...

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.310
I meant...

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.750
What?

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.270
I meant to wish you a long life—

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.600
may you live 1000 years.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.210
Well, thank you so much.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.360
On this mountain,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.159
all the graves are earth burials, right?

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.680
Yes.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.430
In the old days,
most villagers who died tragically

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.800
or took their own lives

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.420
couldn't be buried
in the ancestral mountain.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.480
You can open the coffin now, sir.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.800
Good luck with the opening.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.000
Tong Hao.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.900
Come here.

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.159
Take off my watch.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.610
Walk around me once.

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.090
Put it back on me.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.760
Look.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.580
See?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.190
The watch crown?

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.590
Right.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.550
Normally,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.630
when you wear a watch, the crown

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.830
should point to your hand,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.830
not your arm, right?

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.310
See?

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.070
If he put it on wrong before going out,

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.600
he couldn't have

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.450
gone all day without noticing.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.980
Exactly.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.130
Can you tell

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.870
the cause and time of death?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.970
If it was pathological

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.560
or from external injury,

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.270
given the condition of the body,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.870
the cause would be hard to determine.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.330
But if it was from a strong

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360
external impact

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.970
causing bone damage

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.360
or poisoning,

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.110
then it's possible.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.000
But the most important thing now

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.120
is to confirm the identity of the body.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.160
Then compare it with

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.980
Xu Caizeng.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.190
And Tong Hao and I

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.270
will head back to the city now

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.950
to retrieve

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.800
the files of Xu Qingli's case back then.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.680
We'll be going then.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.480
-Xu.
-Okay.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.470
Thanks for your hard work.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.750
Bye.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.370
Take care.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.040
Bye, Ms. Xia.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.440
We won't see you off then.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.460
We're leaving.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.570
What are you doing?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.970
What's going on

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:45.900
between you two?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.190
Who?

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.310
Me and Xia Jie?

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.870
Did you hear anything?

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:55.520
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.840
Well,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.680
we...

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.230
First of all, Ms. Xia

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.180
is definitely a good person.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.240
So you're not a good person?

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.600
I'm a good person too.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.430
Here's how it is.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.110
We grew up together.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.630
Then in college,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.630
we went to the same university,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.830
so we started dating.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.680
Back then,
we didn't think too much about it.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.310
You know?

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.360
We were both focused

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.430
on our little dreams,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.630
doing our own things.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.730
Understand?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.680
No, I don't.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.560
Have you ever been in a relationship?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.000
Yes.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.000
Let me tell you,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.430
dating and marriage are different.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.000
After marriage,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.390
all sorts of issues came up.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.800
At that time,
there were a lot of things going on at home,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.630
and a lot of work stuff as well.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.480
You know

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.190
our line of work.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.650
And then

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.170
I told her,

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.060
"You stay home.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.920
Our family needs you."

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.720
She said, "You stay home.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.600
Our family needs you."

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.240
I said, "That won't work.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.750
I need to work."

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.390
She said, "That won't work.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.450
I need to work too."

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.780
So we divorced.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.480
Got it?

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.159
Not really.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.800
You're so stupid.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.120
Thanks.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.070
Thanks.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.310
Don't bring this up with anyone
when you go back,

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:56.680
okay?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.190
Okay.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.870
Uncle Xu.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.250
We've reviewed those case files.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.160
Legally, there's no loophole.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.950
But after the suspect Xu Qingli

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.560
died,

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.960
the case was suspended.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.040
I know what's written in the files

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.100
better than you do.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.040
I can recite it by heart.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.429
The evidence in the files

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.530
has already formed a closed loop.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.909
Once the loop is formed,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:36.880
any

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.480
suspicious points

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.630
find it very hard to fit in.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.320
By the way,

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.360
back then,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.030
Bao Desheng

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.230
was lying right here.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.290
Xu.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.720
Were there

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.970
any other suspicious points at the scene?

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:52.900
You could say so.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.140
But those

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.510
hardly count as evidence,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:55.960
so they weren't

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.470
recorded in the files.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.000
Xu Qingli's case

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.210
definitely started with Bao Desheng.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.720
He had the motive.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.360
But

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.900
why did Bao Desheng

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.960
suddenly appear here

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.720
out of nowhere?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.440
Who brought him here?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.500
How did he get here?

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.480
Xu Qingli's place

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.720
is extremely far from here.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.390
If he really was the murderer,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.920
how did he travel back and forth?

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.320
I remember

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.270
the case files didn't mention

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.130
anything about transportation.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.960
On the night Bao Desheng died,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.030
less than a kilometer west of here,

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.790
in a small village,

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.270
there was a traffic accident.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.210
I was just about to go to bed

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.880
when I suddenly heard
a loud crash outside.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.690
All the plastic barrels
in front of my house

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.380
were knocked over.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.430
Look.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.670
A man

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.200
on a motorcycle

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.340
fell over by the barrels.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.490
It was quite a bad fall.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.680
When he got up to lift the motorcycle,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.210
I saw there was a large patch

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.320
of blood on him.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.390
I don't know

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.680
if it was from the fall

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.910
or something else.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.240
Before I could react,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.370
he got on the motorcycle and rode away.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.400
Xu.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.170
We just received a report.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.300
A male body was found

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.110
near the old bridge wasteland.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.680
What model was the motorcycle?

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.040
A standard motorcycle.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.790
That's another strange point.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.720
Afterwards,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.060
I visited Xu Qingli's coworkers.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.480
First,

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.230
this guy didn't have a motorcycle;

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.000
second,

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.490
he didn't know
how to ride a standard motorcycle.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.550
This case is fundamentally flawed.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.080
They say it was a crime of passion

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.280
over a relationship.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.200
But the files

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.120
describe it as a typical case
of killing for profit.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.510
Yes.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.390
Not only

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.270
were the watch and gold necklace

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:11.930
on him gone,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.050
but also a leather bag.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.670
That bag contained

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.330
the gift money Bao Desheng had collected

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:18.860
that day.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:20.610
It was gone too.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.360
Latre,

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.310
the task force

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.120
searched every place in Jialin City

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.850
that could fence stolen goods—

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.320
antique shops,

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:28.670
pawnshops,

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.120
legal and illegal,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:30.960
underground and legitimate—

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.870
but found

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.120
no trace

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.330
of the stolen items.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:36.970
Uncle Xu,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.440
do you think the real killer

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.720
is someone else?

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.240
Although

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.000
there were testimonies,

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.750
there was no evidence proving

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.280
Xu Qingli was the murderer.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.150
Even if

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.420
it is someone else,

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.150
I have no proof.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.840
After all,
everyone is innocent until proven guilty.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.030
When Xu Qingli died,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.780
our only suspect was gone too.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.810
The evidence chain lacked eyewitnesses

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.270
and crucial statements,

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.490
so the case was suspended.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.940
But suspension doesn't mean
the case is closed.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.390
If the evidence chain is incomplete,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.650
the truth will always be missing a piece.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.360
So I...

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.820
Why am I telling you all this?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.060
It's about time.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.510
Time to go to the airport.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.390
This time, you came

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.870
on official business,
so it's inconvenient.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:31.910
Next time you come to Jialin,

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:32.600
come see me.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.970
I'll host a feast

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:34.630
with plenty of alcohol.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:34.960
Sure.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.510
Alright.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.330
Let's go.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.850
I'll send you there.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.700
Alright, Captain Ma.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.430
I'll tell my mentor right away.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.370
Mentor.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.000
What is it?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.070
There's a new lead on Ni Xiangdong's

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.070
remittance slip.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.580
Chu Xiao

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.960
found the post office stub.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.000
They compared the handwriting

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.570
and confirmed
they were all sent by the same person.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.600
The money was sent to several cities,

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.270
each one farther north

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.470
along the coastline.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.360
Each one farther north?

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:25.750
Yes.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.730
They said

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.240
it stopped at Weihai.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.200
Mentor,

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.510
isn't this too much of a coincidence?

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.390
Wu Ximei also said

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.960
he was heading straight north.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.670
Normally,
people from Nanyang who go out to work

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.670
first choose the Pearl River Delta,

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.880
because it's close.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:39.670
If they go further north,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.670
it would be the Yangtze River Delta.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.530
So why did they come to Weihai?

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.440
There's not a single reason

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.550
for them to settle

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.690
and work in Weihai.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.440
None.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.090
I don't understand.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.870
This guy is like a cat,

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.970
drawn by the smell of fish.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.250
This behavior is indeed strange.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.570
It seems off.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:01.870
If we can figure out

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.000
why they came to Weihai,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.660
we might find a breakthrough.

Sir.

Are you going to stay?

Yes.

No way.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.480

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.000

it's the Labor Bureau's job.

I went to the Labor Bureau;

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.050
they said without contracts,

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:32.920
we're working illegally.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.450

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.750

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.710
there was only an old man
at the security booth.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.280
What do you mean?

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440
What do you think?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:53.880
This bundle of wire

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.740
could sell for hundreds outside.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:57.790
You want to steal it?

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.030
It's only stealing if you get caught.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.690
Otherwise, it's just taking.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.290
What's wrong with you?

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.270
What if...

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.940
someone sees us?

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.960
See us?

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:08.790
You're such a coward.

You're used to the sound of waves.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:08.770
Find a city by the sea.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:10.929
Listening to the waves

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.199
will help you sleep better.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.030
Excuse me.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.880
Does this lighthouse really exist?

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.510
Yes.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.659
It's in Weihai.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.110
Weihai.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.360
Come.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.400
Here.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.580
Put it here.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.280
Here.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:39.920
Here?

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:40.510
Yes.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.320
Excuse me.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.730
What place is this painting of?

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.350
Wenping Lighthouse.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.620
It looks a lot like the sea
in my hometown,

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.360
but not exactly the same.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.440
The sea in my hometown is

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.340
golden and bright.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.670
The sand there is very fine

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.110
and soft.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.400
Excuse me.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:31.840
Do you have any

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.370
extra copies of that photo?

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.410
That's enough.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.240
Bless us with safety and peace.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.550
Alright.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.590
Ms. Li.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.400
What?

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:50.590
Auntie.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.670
Have you seen Wu Ximei these days?

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.110
Who?

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:54.960
Wu Ximei.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.300
The girl lives on the third floor.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.630
I haven't paid attention.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:59.280
Granny,

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.920
it's not a holiday or festival.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.050
Why are you praying?

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.210
Well, recently,

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.070
I feel our

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:05.920
neighborhood isn't very safe.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.070
Right?

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:08.590
Look, first it was Li Qingfu

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.590
from Qu's family,

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.360
right?

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.690
And my granddaughter is still young.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.590
So,

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.530
what if something happens to her?

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.630
That's why I'm praying for safety.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:18.740
That day,

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.580
she told me

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.890
that when she got up to go
to the bathroom…

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.560
It's nothing.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.980
What-what happened, Auntie?

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.270
And then?

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:29.360
Nothing.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.230
Nothing.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.030
Just tell us.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.070
It's okay, ma'am.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:32.550
It's...

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.390
useless.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.400
Don't believe

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.390
what kids say.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.290
We're police officers.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.730
Tell us

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.880
if you have any

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.320
reliable information.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.580
If the case gets solved

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:42.360
and the bad guys are caught,

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.760
won't this place be safe?

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.740
She said that

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.440
when she got up
to go to the bathroom at night,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.280
she saw our neighbor,

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.850
Cao Xiaojun.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.810
Come in, please.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.170
Take a look at our little house.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:00.880
Look.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.190
It's a small place.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.510
Lele.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.590
Why haven't you taken your medicine?

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.190
Grandma, I'm all better now.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:11.960
Come in, please.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.800
Should we

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.630
change our shoes?

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:14.530
No need.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.020
No need.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.410
Please, have a seat.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.880
My son

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.160
and his wife live in the inner room.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.480
Lele and I sleep here.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:23.320
That's nice.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:24.590
My son

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.520
drives a taxi with a partner.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:28.150
He often works night shifts.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.920
His wife

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.490
works at a biscuit factory.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.150
It's a three-shift rotation.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.320
So most of the time,

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.630
it's just

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:36.510
my granddaughter and me at home.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:37.710
Lele,

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:38.960
I heard

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.880
from your grandma

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.680
that you were sick a few days ago.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:42.700
It's fine.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.440
Mom and Grandma

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.920
said I had a fever.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.230
They said I caught a chill.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.230
Which day did you catch a chill?

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.340
The day before yesterday.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:57.320
Was it the day before yesterday
or the one before that?

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.320
Think carefully.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.630
It was the day I went to school.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.760
That night, when I was going to bed,

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.840
I needed to pee,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.320
and then

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.440
I heard a noise outside the door.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.210
So I looked outside through the peephole.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.210
What did you see?

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.630
I saw Uncle Cao

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:30.360
coming out of his apartment.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.070
And then?

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:36.800
That's all.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.400
I went back to sleep.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.630
Are you sure the person you saw

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.590
was Uncle Cao?

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.630
Lele.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.320
Think carefully.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:45.840
The man you saw

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.510
through the peephole—

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.360
did he have a scar here?

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.110
The one with the scar is Uncle Ni.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.510
Uncle Cao doesn't have one.
