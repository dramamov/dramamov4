Miss, would you like a newspaper?

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.980
Take care.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.620
Head back.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.260
See you.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.820
Go on back.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.700
Feelings should always
come after our positions.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.460
The positions we stand for

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.220
are no longer the same.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.140
You're right about that.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.980
I almost forgot.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.700
You're with an organization now, right?

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.540
From now on,
we'll keep to our own paths.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.700
Eat a bit more.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.980
It's a long way back to Chongqing.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.220
So...

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.660
you couldn't stay after all.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.810
Once the War of Resistance is won,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.250
I'll deal with these Reds

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.020
one by one, with my own hands.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.220
Guess fate really brought us together.

Charlie.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.340
Looks like Chief Cao
didn't tell you a thing.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.340
It was urgent, so we left in a rush.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.540
Now I don't have

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.580
vintage French wine to offer you.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.220
I know exactly what you're thinking.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.220
That I should've died
at Cao Yuanzhong's hands,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.900
instead of standing here, right?

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.580
Let me tell you this,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.100
I'm not as simple as you think.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.700
I've got more than
a list of strongholds.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.820
I still have loads of trump cards.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.580
But the most important one

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.220
was bought with my wife's life.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.980
It was all because of my Yin

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.260
that I've survived till now.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.380
You wouldn't understand.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.650
You just don't get it.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.100
Because we're not the same.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.460
We were never the same from birth.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.020
Some bonds run deep, some are brief.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.100
Some roads are long, some are short.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.690
But I chose every step myself.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.460
There's one thing you should know.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.140
Charlie, teach me something.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.530
When I'm back in Chongqing,
how should I write the report?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.020
What report?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.860
Chief Cao issued me
a Letter of Appointment,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.020
stating I'm part
of the Sword Thrust Operation,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.140
an undercover in the Japanese agency.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.500
But in your earlier reports,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.860
my name's not on it.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.810
So we need to smooth this over.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.860
I helped you plenty before.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.100
Back in Chongqing, you owe me one.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.860
As brothers do.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.460
Of course, I'll help.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.340
But Liang,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.620
how did you get out of Shanghai?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.620
I still have no idea.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.260
How am I supposed to cover this?

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.620
I can't help you with that now.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:45.860
I'll go.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.740
He must still have useful intel.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.460
We couldn't get it out of him.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.140
He can't die yet.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.620
We came here to ask for guidance.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.860
Since you said

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.740
we're on the same team,

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.100
when we get back,

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.530
we should have each other's back.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.460
The operation isn't enough
to make someone a Major General.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.220
But maybe,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.740
it's worth a couple of Colonel ranks.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.020
From what I know,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.740
the rank of Deputy Chief,
China Hong Kong Bureau,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.260
should be Colonel, right?

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.860
People

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.620
like us do is just getting by.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.570
It may look glamorous,

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.740
but the road is full of obstacles.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.500
People have their little schemes,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.740
but fate has its own bigger plan.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.020
No matter how loyal we are,

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.980
we're still just

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.570
a piece that can be tossed
aside anytime.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.260
Here you are,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.020
risking your life
fighting for your party,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.740
covering for your teammates,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.740
but your country?

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.140
They'd rather protect that one person

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.860
and just threw you away

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.140
like tossing out an old rag.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.980
Turns out, in your Party-State,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.260
not every life carries the same weight.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.020
That feeling
that no one cares your life,

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.340
you should understand it better than I.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.770
I've already won this bet.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.100
Let me tell you right now,

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.020
why Cao Yuanzhong can't touch me.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.890
Many in the Wang Government

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.500
have stashed amounts of gold
in China Hong Kong,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.380
along with antiques.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.980
I did tell Cao Yuanzhong about it,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.100
but only I know the exact locations.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.380
All the seized spoils
go directly to Mr. Dai,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.860
so no one can lay a hand on me.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.020
Not even you.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.460
Liang, your moves are impressive.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.140
Come on.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.980
Charlie.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.620
I hope you won't let me down.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.380
Director Dai

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.570
has been anxiously
waiting for me in Chongqing.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.220
If Director Dai can't get this money,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.620
he won't spare your family.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.460
The Gu family will cover this amount.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.610
Even if it costs us everything,

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.980
just to trade for a traitor's life,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.650
it's worth it.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.140
I won't let you return to Chongqing.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.140
Luo Han.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.380
Luo Han once betrayed you.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.490
Luo Han.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.020
Do you believe what he says?

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:29.860
What?

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.890
Do you...

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.810
believe what he says?

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.460
I believe you.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.050
I believe you.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.340
In the years that followed,

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.860
there were countless guardians
like Ding Yi,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:32.650
fighting on

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.860
hidden fronts of the War of Resistance.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.170
They blistered their heels

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.220
to deliver intel

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.410
during the massive raids
when radios were scarce.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.930
They became the half-buried bones,

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.140
moss-covered,
left in the foreign jungles

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.140
of the Battle
of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.140
And in the Battle of Hengyang,

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.860
they cast one last look at China's land

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:02.410
even when their eyes were blood-blinded.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.810
On August 15, 1945,

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.530
Japan announced
its unconditional surrender.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.460
The Chinese nation,
like a tenacious fighter,

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.900
finally claimed victory that day.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:27.770
From that day on,

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.700
it would only grow stronger.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.850
From that day on,

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.180
it would live in freedom.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.370
Victory forever!

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.530
Victory forever!

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.090
Victory forever!

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.850
National liberation!

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.050
National liberation!

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.810
Punish the traitors!

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.330
Disband the puppet troops!

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.610
Miss, want to join us?

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.130
That way leads to Sanyangli.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.220
Are you from Sanyangli?

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.050
It's a misunderstanding.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.770
We're just passing through.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.130
But I saw Sanyangli's main gate

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.610
is already locked up.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.020
If you want to get in,

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.020
you'd better bring some gear.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.530
What did you say?

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.130
Hold on.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.290
Hold on.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.370
Here, take this.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:50.850
Hit it harder.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.180
Thanks, comrade.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.570
Classmates,
ahead is the traitors' hideout.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.090
Let's rush in!

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.850
Charge!

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.020
Punish the traitors!
Disband the puppet troops!

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.370
Punish the traitors!

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.420
Punish the traitors!

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.330
We've finally waited for this day.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.570
Comrade Xiao,

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.810
hello.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.610
Let me formally introduce myself.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.180
I'm Ding Yi.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.330
No longer Joseph Lee?

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.130
This contains records since 1940.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.020
It's the work report from me
and Comrade Biyun.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.610
It also includes reports from
Comrade Gu Fuhua,

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.420
Comrade Zhu Hongyu,
and Comrade Shen Wanqing.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.370
Please have the Organization review it.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.850
We must always keep in mind

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.770
all this blood and sacrifice.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.130
It can never be forgotten.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.370
Comrade Biyun said,

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.810
back then, things were urgent.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.290
I joined the party on the front line.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.050
There was no time
for proper ideological study.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.420
Now the mission is over.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.130
She wants me to return to Yan'an

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.220
to make up for the missed classes.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.570
It's Comrade Biyun's idea.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.610
But your words and tone show

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.220
you have your own thoughts.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.180
That's right.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.020
Biyun and I

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.610
met at the Chaosheng Troupe.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.770
It was also my only home in Shanghai.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.900
So I was thinking,

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.530
maybe we could have the wedding there

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.530
before going to Yan'an.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.610
And is Biyun okay with that?

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:53.610
Of course, she agrees.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.130
My wife always listens to me.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.130
That's not what I meant.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.610
What I mean is,

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:01.370
my wife...

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.370
Comrade Biyun listens to
the Organization even more.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.610
If the Organization approves,

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.530
she'll have no objections.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.900
Comrade Ding Yi, your wedding

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.570
is of course up to you two.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.090
We'll fully support whatever you need.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.850
Anything else?

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.370
Comrade Xiao,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.130
in the materials I gave you,

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.220
there's also a briefing
on my partner, Gu Yangshan.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.570
Our comrade

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.940
has made contact with him in Chongqing.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:28.740
Actually,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.260
he's long been disappointed
with the Kuomintang and the BIS.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.090
He was planning to
leave with his father.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.050
But now we've won the victory.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.570
He wants to stay here with his father.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.420
They hope to push for peace
between the two parties.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.290
So, will he be joining us?

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.570
Yes, he will.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.090
[Beloved Daughter Gu Bingqing]
He's been searching for the right path.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.050
He's just missing the final key.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.260
Alright, I get it now.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.050
At the same time,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.460
there's another important task.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.700
Isn't Chairman Mao already in Chongqing

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.770
negotiating with Chiang Kai-shek?

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.020
Could anything still change?

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.810
After the invaders surrendered,

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.770
Chongqing negotiated with us
on the surface,

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:17.810
but secretly they surrounded
the Liberated Area

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.770
and even made probing attacks.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.940
They just want to figure out
our bottom line.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.700
This time,

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.260
we cannot make the same mistake.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.570
We have to take precautions.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.260
Lately, the KMT's traitor purge

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.050
has stirred up the whole city.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:40.290
In fact, they're just using it

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.260
to settle scores with our comrades.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:45.570
These doctors are forced to work

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:49.050
[Names of Doctors]
in the Japanese hospitals.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.260
They once helped us.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.530
But now,

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.050
they're on the elimination list.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.050
The Organization has decided to
move them quickly

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.530
to the Liberated Area.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.260
That way, they won't get hurt.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.610
This task is assigned to you two.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.090
First, bring them to the troupe.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.260
Once our comrades arrive for pickup,
leave immediately.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.310
[Meng Jie]

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.050
Meng Jie...

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.290
Please, don't kill me.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.530
I'm not a traitor to the nation.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.290
I once covered
for the Eighth Route Army in Hubei.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:04.530
That makes it even worse for you.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:35.740
I had this made just for you.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.370
Wear it on our wedding day.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.500
Come on, try it and see if it fits.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.260
If not, I can alter it for you.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.330
What's wrong?

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.020
Been wearing Joseph's suits too often?

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.610
Now you don't care for the Chinese suit?

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.610
This afternoon,

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.610
I cleared out all the dorms
of the troupe.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.370
When the doctors arrive,

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.770
they'll still have a place to stay.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.850
But tomorrow,
you need to buy a few mattresses.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.220
The old mattresses

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.220
are all moldy now.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:16.530
You...

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.610
knew it.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.370
I'm actually your direct superior.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.770
I'm sending you to see Xiao

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.290
because I want you
to get familiar with our party,

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.290
not come back all hesitant and vague

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.290
and not even tell me your mission.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:38.050
The list.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:46.700
Here.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.020
To the higher-ups.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.290
If this happens again,

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:51.530
I won't let it slide.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:57.810
Sorry, Biyun.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.290
We've been waiting four years
for this wedding.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.610
Looks like

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.610
we'll have to wait a bit longer.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.960
[Meng Jie]

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.020

[Beloved Daughter Gu Bingqing]

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.770
Dad, take it slow.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:36.770
It's been ten years.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.020
Bingqing can finally rest in peace.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.940
And Uncle Gu too.

[Late Esteemed Gu Gong Fuhua]

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:56.810
Uncle Gu gave his life.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.290
And it wasn't in vain.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:12.020
I've already handed in my resignation.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.330
Now I'm just a free man.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.290
So stop fussing over

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.530
the Joseph Lee cipher.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.740
The Japanese are all gone.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.610
No one's going to use it anymore.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.180
Spend more time with me when you can.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:32.770
And with her too.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.500
Alright.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.020
But I...

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.410
I still enjoy working with math.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.370
And the Joseph Lee cipher

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.330
still holds real value.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.020
Besides, Father, you're in your prime.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.650
Today, state affairs are complex,
while everything needs rebuilding.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.090
There's still so much
waiting for you to handle.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.650
We agreed to go to the United Kingdom.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.330
So let's stop hesitating.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.570
Father.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.570
The War of Resistance is over.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.540
But the Chairman clings
to the idea of civil war.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.410
Everyone hopes you'll join the petition.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.980
Even if they could convince me,

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:36.090
I still couldn't persuade the Chairman.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.410
If I don't hand in my resignation soon,

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.780
I might end up blamed
for starting a civil war.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.330
You'd better not play peacemaker.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.780
Turn around.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.570
Raise your hand.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.020
Higher.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.170
Isn't this way too big?

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.330
It's bigger than my head.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.330
This is for the wedding day.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.740
Sit down.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:50.570
What's on your mind?

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.570
When we first met,

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.850
you looked at me the same way.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.370
You finally don't have to be
someone else.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.020
I finally have a real home now.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.500
Looks like you think so too.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.890
The talks between both parties
don't look promising.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.060
Chairman Chiang, this man...

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.890
He's used to running a one-man show.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.130
Suddenly asking him
to play Pledged Brothers

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.810
is just not his thing.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.890
But since I was young,
you always taught me

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:15.890
where there's a will, there's a way.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.740
We've been fighting for fourteen years.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:22.370
Now unity, peace, and reunification

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:25.330
are what people hope for.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:27.570
People long for stability, Father.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.570
No matter how much power
Chairman Chiang has,

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.300
it's not greater than the people's will.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.330
It's a crucial moment for talks.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:36.570
Are you really going to step back now?

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.570
If I stay, what's the point?

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:44.130
Do I follow Zhang Xueliang
and Yang Hucheng's path

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.370
and stage an armed petition?

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.650
Holding Chairman Chiang's hand.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.330
Urging him to sign the agreement.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.060
Father.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:56.650
But do you really

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:57.890
want to just stand by and watch them

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.090
use the name of eliminating traitors

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.090
to settle scores between the parties?

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:05.130
Now in Shanghai, fear is everywhere.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.570
The Elimination Committee
arrests and releases people

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.410
without going through any trial at all.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.890
Everything depends on their whims.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.700
They even set up by the Huangpu River

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.090
a temporary execution ground.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.650
They openly shoot
those they label as traitors.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.570
Gunfire echoes from morning till night,

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:23.650
never stopping for a moment.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.090
If you step down now,

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:28.850
who else can keep them in check?

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.460
Is this really what our Gu Family

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.410
fought for over generations
to see happen?

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.090
Outrageous.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.170
Yangshan.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.130
You've been back for over five years.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.570
So tell me.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.460
How much of
Three Principles of the People

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.090
have truly been realized?

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:55.890
Nothing but an empty name.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.410
Have we ever abused our posts for gain

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.130
or taken bribes or twisted the law?

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.060
We can answer with a clear conscience.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.410
If every figure in the Party-State

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:12.940
served the nation and the people
with fairness and honesty,

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.090
then why is today's China

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.570
still struggling
with industries in decline?

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.410
Yangshan.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.610
When I was young, I was just like you,

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.300
believing people could conquer fate.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.700
But after most of my life has passed,

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.370
looking back, I've achieved nothing.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.170
And I've come to see I've grown old.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.850
Nothing is in our control anymore.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.060
I can't handle the matter
of traitor elimination.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.610
And you shouldn't push yourself either.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.060
We should just hurry and find Miss Meng.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:03.500
Get her out of Shanghai.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:07.540
That way, the Gu family
gives her a proper answer.

then Bingqing

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.380

sacrifice herself.

had his eye

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.940
on a house by the Huangpu River.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:11.170
But he had Meng Mingyi transfer it
to his daughter.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.940
That's how it's written on the deed.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.570
What a pity.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.090
Such a lovely young woman.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.900
I was thinking of sparing her.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:28.610
What kind of father does that?

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.090
Isn't he putting his daughter
in harm's way?

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.420
Let's stick to the usual plan.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.460
Deputy Director Mao
will soon arrive here

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.610
to give guidance for the Shanghai BIS.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.500
We can't have him
without a place to stay.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.940
This calls for special arrangements.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.900
We'll get that father and daughter
to confess today.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.460
Tomorrow, we'll confiscate the property.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.020
The doctors we could find

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.250
have all been sent back to the troupe.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:03.460

I'll report to Xiao.
