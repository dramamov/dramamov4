00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.520
Mr. He, any news?

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.800
Thank you.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.600
Hello, Brother Yao.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.039
Yes.

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.440
I should be around 24 or 5 years old now.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.360
Brother Hu, it's been ten years.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.560
Don't just look for Hu.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.600
I don't want him to change his surname.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.560
Don't limited to the city, suburbs.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.000
Check Jiangsu, Zhejiang area.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.759
Pay attention.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.240
Especially those bad places.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.400
Bad places?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.560
Are you sure?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.040
Stay still. Let's go.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.200
Let go of me!

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.120
Cut the crap.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.920
Behave yourself.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.000
Stop!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.360
Thank you.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.200
Stop!

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.400
I'm talking to you.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.440
Why did you take him away?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.560
Hello, have you seen the man in the photo?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.920
Can't you see the police working? No.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.880
Thank you.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.240
Don't move.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.480
You said police are police.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.040
Police need certificates to solve cases.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.400
What about the ID?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.520
Are you on the same side?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.079
What if we don't have the ID?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.200
What?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.280
Beat him.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.880
Come on!

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.560
Stop!

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.280
I'm Chief Zhou Mu of the Municipal Bureau.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.079
Everyone, raise your head and squat down.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.880
Get down!

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.079
Boss.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.800
Take them all away.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.720
Stop!

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.360
Boss.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.880
Take him back to the station.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.400
Okay.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.040
Let's go.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.920
What's wrong? Do you need help?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.280
I'm sorry.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.800
I was working on a case.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.440
I had no choice.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.840
That's enough.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.560
I'm angry.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.800
So you get angry too.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.360
You know it's annoying.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.560
You...

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.280
Give it to me.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.160
Are you looking for her?

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800
You know Hu Juan too?

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.120
Yes.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.840
Her sister came to the police.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.320
It's a long time ago.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.800
There are too few clues.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920
We've been looking for her very hard.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.440
She came to us too.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.160
You...

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.440
Me and my friends.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.640
Why won't you listen to me?

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.280
Who are you? Why should I listen to you?

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.560
What? Catch me?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.360
Give it to me.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.040
I can catch you.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.360
They're not good people. I told you.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.280
That's because of the police.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280
We all work hard.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.200
Of course.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.120
Mr. Zhou is an honest man.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.360
Donâ€™t fall into my hands one day.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.159
Hu Juan has been found.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.240
Hurry up and inform Hu Li.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.240
This...

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.800
What should we do?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.280
Yan, go take a look.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.520
Jinjing together.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.160
Let's go.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.120
I'm going to the toilet.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.080
Get the money ready when I come back.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.000
Go to hell!

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.680
Why didn't you drown in the toilet?

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.000
You...

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.320
If I drown in the toilet,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.560
where will you find your father?

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.840
You can't find your father even if you cry.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.640
Get lost!

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.400
How dare you hit me!

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.040
Wait and see.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.120
Get lost as far as you can!

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.440
What are you doing?

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.280
Massage

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.560
No problem.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.040
As long as the money is enough,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.000
Female guests are fine too.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.520
Cover your nose.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.720
What?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.440
Cover your nose.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.600
Who are you?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.360
The more you suck,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.240
the more you suck, the faster you die.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.720
Are you a doctor?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.440
Do I look like I'm afraid of death?

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.800
Look at you.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.960
your sister, Hu Li,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.000
she'll be so sad.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.400
Hu Li asked us to find you.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.120
She wants to see you.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.000
She wants to live her life.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.920
I live my life.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.840
Why do you want to see me?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.360
What's there to see?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.960
I don't want to see her.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.520
But she has been looking for you for many years.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.960
She cares about you.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.680
If she sees you like this,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.400
she'll be heartbroken.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.920
What about me?

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.360
It's up to me.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.560
It's none of your business.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.360
Get lost!

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.240
Hu Juan.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.680
Get lost!

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.040
We mean no harm.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.240
Don't do this. Get lost.

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:47.440
She's been thinking about you.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.000
She hasn't changed her name for the past ten years.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.240
She didn't follow her adoptive parents' surname.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.680
I'm afraid you can't find her.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.680
I said I...

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.160
You are Hu Qiang.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.560
Hu Qiang, how dare you come here?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.000
Get lost!

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.200
Juan!

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.120
How could you speak to your father like that?

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.960
My father died long ago.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:20.960
You are my father.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.280
Why are you still alive?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.000
Why are you getting mad?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.960
I'll ask you for money for cigarettes and alcohol.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:27.800
I told you.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.640
I have no money.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.400
No money?

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.680
Okay.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.960
If you don't have money, I'll ask someone else.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.720
You know Sumire?

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.280
Where is she?

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.559
I have nothing to say to you human trafficker.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.760
Say it again.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.720
What are you doing?

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.040
She's a clean girl.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:48.960
Don't touch her.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.080
Come at me if you need anything.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:52.680
Okay.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.280
Where is Sumire?

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.840
If you don't tell me,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.720
I can find her.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.640
My eldest daughter doesn't want me anymore.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.440
I'm looking for my little daughter.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.240
Wait and see.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.920
You want money, right?

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.240
Here you are.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.040
All for you.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.720
I need money.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.400
It's all here.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.600
Hu Qiang.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.400
Don't push your luck.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.640
If you go to Sumire,

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.240
I'll die with you.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.360
Let's both die.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.080
Although I like money,

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.680
From now on,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.920
you're still my good daughter.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.840
Hu Juan.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.320
Don't let Hu Qiang know where Xiaoli is.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.120
As for whether to see her or not,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.280
I'll think about it.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:30.720
Let's go.
